\section{Ford-Fulkson Algorithm and The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem}


\subsection*{Ford-Fulkson Algorithm}

The Ford-Fulkson algorithm aims to find a maximum-flow of the given network.
It employs the idead of \emph{iterative improving}. The algorithm
starts from a trivial flow $f$ with $f(e) = 0$ for every $e\in E$.
It then iteratively improve $f$.
In each iteration, it finds a path $p$ from $s$ to $t$ in the so-called \emph{residual graph w.r.t.\ the current flow $f$},
and then improve $f$ by \emph{augmenting} path $p$.
The value of $f$ will be increased after each iteration,
and the algorithm will terminate when such path cann't be found.

\subsection*{Residual Graph}

The residual graph plays a central role in the Ford-Fulkson algorithm and in
proving the max-flow min-cut theorem. Let $f$ be an $s$-$t$ flow of a network
$(G = (V,E),s,t,c)$. We denote by $G_f =(V,E_f)$ the residual graph w.r.t.\ $f$. 
We emphasize that a residual graph is always associated with (i.e., w.r.t.) a flow of a network.
Each edge $e\in E_f$ in the residual graph is also associated with a capacity, denoted as $c_f(e)$. 
The construction of the residual graph is given below.  See Figure~\ref{fig:residual-graph}.
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The residual graph has the same set of vertices with the network.
\item For each edge $(u,v)\in E$, there are two corresponding edges in
$E_f$: the \emph{forward-edge} $(u,v)$ with capacity $c_f (u, v) = c(u,v) - f(u,v)$, 
and the \emph{backward-edge} $(v, u)$ with capacity $c_f (v, u) = f(u,v)$. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{residual-graph}}
\caption{Definition of edges and capacities of the residual graph.}
\label{fig:residual-graph}
\end{figure}

Edges in the residual graph with capacity of 0 will be removed. In other words,
we always assume that edges in the residual graph have positive
capacities. Therefore, if an edge $e = (u,v) \in E$ in the network carries a
flow of 0, i.e., $f(e) = 0$, then the residual graph only includes the
corresponding forward-edge $(u, v)$ with capacity $c_f (u, v) = c(e)$; if an
edge $e = (u, v) \in E$  is \emph{saturated}, i.e., $f (e) = c(e)$, then the residual
graph only includes the corresponding backward-edge $(v, u)$ with capacity
$c_f (v, u) = f(e) = c(e)$. See Figure 2.

\subsection*{The Ford-Fulkson Algorithm}

Recall that the central idea of the FF algorithm is to iteratively improve an
$s$-$t$ flow $f$, initialized with $f(e) = 0$ for every $e \in E$. In each iteration, it
seeks a path $p$ from $s$ to $t$, called an $s$-$t$ path, in residual graph $G_f$ w.r.t.\ the
current flow $f$; it then augments $p$ to obtain a flow with increased value. The
algorithm terminates when such $s$-$t$ path cann’t be found. The pseudo-code is
given below.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {8}{Algorithm Ford-Fulkson~($G = (V, E), s, t, c$)}\xxx
	\aab {init an $s$-$t$ flow $f$ with $f(e) = 0$ for any $e\in E$;}\xxx
	\aaB {5}{while~(true)}\xxx
	\aac {build the residual graph $G_f$ w.r.t.\ the current flow $f$;}\xxx
	\aac {find an $s$-$t$ path $p$ in $G_f$;}\xxx
	\aac {if such path cannot be found: return $f$;}\xxx
	\aac {$f \leftarrow augment(f,p)$;}\xxx
	\aab {end;}\xxx
	\aaa {end;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

To augment an $s$-$t$ path $p$ in $G_f$, we first calcualte the bottleneck capacity of
$p$, which is defined as the smallest capacity of all edges in $p$, formally
written as $x(p) := \min_{e\in p} c_f(e)$. We then examine each edge $e \in p$, and
update the flow of the corresponding edge in the network with the following rule.

\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $e = (u,v) \in p$ is a forward edge, i.e., $(u,v)$ is in the network, we update $f(u,v) \leftarrow f(u,v)+x(p)$;
\item If $e = (u,v) \in p$ is a backward edge, i.e., $(v,u)$ is in the network, we update $f(v,u) \leftarrow f(v,u)-x(p)$;
\end{enumerate}

The flow of other edges in the network (i.e., none of their corresponding
forward edges or backward edges is in $p$) will not get affected. See an
example in Figure~\ref{fig:augment}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{augment}}
\caption{Illustrating the procedure of augmenting continuing Figure~\ref{fig:example}. Suppose
in the residual graph $G_f$ given in Figure~\ref{fig:example} the algorithm identifies $s$-$t$
path $p = (s,a,c,t)$. Note that in this path $(s,a)$ and $(c,t)$ are forward
edges and $(a, c)$ is backward edge. After augmenting $p$ the flow $f$ is given in the right figure,
where affected flow are circled.}
\label{fig:augment}
\end{figure}

We emphasize that, after augmenting, $f$ remains a valid flow, i.e., $f$ satisfies
both the capacity condition and the conservation condition. The capacity
condition remains satisfied owes to how the residual graph is constructed.
Consider the two cases in augmenting: in either case, after augmenting, the
flow remains non-negative and bounded by the capacity. Specifically,

\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $e=(u,v)\in p$ is a forward edge, we know that $c_f(e)=c(u,v)-f(u,v)$ based on the
construction of the residual graph. Since $x( p) \le c_f (e)$, after augmenting the
flow of edge $(u, v)$ becomes $f(u, v) + x(p) \le f(u,v)+c_f (e) = f(u,v)+c(u,v)- f(u,v) = c(u,v)$. 
And it’s obvious that $f(u,v)+x(p) \ge 0$.
\item if $e=(u,v)\in p$ is a backward edge, we know that $c_f(e)=f(v,u)$ based on the
construction of the residual graph. Since $x(p) \le c_f(e)$, after augmenting the
flow of edge $(v, u)$ becomes $f(v, u) - x(p) \ge f(v,u)-c_f (e) = f(v,u)-f(v,u) = 0$. 
And it’s obvious that $f(v,u)-x(p) \le f(v,u) \le c(v,u)$.
\end{enumerate}

The reason why the conservation condition remains satisfied is that we augment an entire $s$-$t$ path. Hence,
for any vertex $v$ in path $p$ except $s$ and $t$, the augmenting procedure adjusts the
flow of two adjacent edges of $v$ in the network, and such adjustments always
cancel out. For example, suppose that in path $p$ the two edges are $(u,v)$ and
$(v,w)$. If both edges are forward edges, then both $f(u,v)$ and $f(v,w)$ are
increased by $x(p)$; so $v$ remains balanced; If $(u, v)$ is a forward edge and $(v,
		w)$ is a backward edge, then $f (u, v)$ is increased by $x(p)$ and $f(w,v)$ is
decreased by $x(p)$; again, $v$ remains balanced; other two cases can be verified
similarly.

After augmenting path $p$, the value of the new flow becomes $|f|+x(p)$. Since we
assume that all edges in the residual graph has positive capacity, we have that
$x(p) > 0$, which means the value of the new flow always gets improved. If we
further assume that all capacities are integers, we have $x(p) \ge 1$ and therefore
the value of the new flow will be increased by at least 1 in each iteration.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{ff}}
\caption{Running the FF algorithm on an instance. Each row shows an iteration. The left column shows
the current flow $f$. The right column shows the residual graph w.r.t.\ $f$ and the $s$-$t$ path found (in blue).}
\label{fig:ff}
\end{figure}

See running the Ford-Fulkson algorithm on an instance in Figure~\ref{fig:ff}.
The FF algorithm runs in $O(|f^*|\cdot(|V|+|E|))$ time,
where $f^*$ is the flow returned by the FF. 
This is because, each iteration (including building $G_f$, finding an $s$-$t$ path $p$ in $G_f$
with BFS/DFS, and augmenting $p$) takes $O(|V|+|E|)$ time, and in each iteration,
the value of the flow is increased by at least 1~(assuming that all capacities are integers),
so the number of iterations needed is $O(|f^*|)$.


\subsection*{The Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem}

We now prove that the FF algorithm is optimal, which also directly implies the so-called max-flow min-cut
theorem.  Again let $f^*$ be the flow when the FF terminates. Note that the residual graph $G_{f^*}$ w.r.t.\ $f^*$ does
not have any $s$-$t$ path (or equivalently, $s$ cannot reach $t$ in $G_{f^*}$), because otherwise the FF algorithm will
not terminate. Now we define a cut: let $S^*$ be the set of vertices in  $G_{f^*}$ that can be reached from $s$, formally 
$S^* := \{v\in V\mid s \textrm{ can reach $v$ in } G_{f^*} \}$,
and define $T^* = V\setminus S^*$.
Clearly, $s\in S^*$.  Since $s$ cannot reach $t$ in $G_{f^*}$, we know that $t\in T^*$. Hence
$(S^*, T^*)$ is an $s$-$t$ cut. For example, in Figure~4, $S^* = \{s,b\}$ and $T^* = \{a,t\}$.

We now show the central result: $|f^*| = c(S^*,T^*)$. Recall the Fact 1 in Lecture
37: the value of any flow, here we focus on $f^*$, can be calculated with any $s$-$t$
cut, and here we will use the particular cut $(S^*,T^*)$.
Specifically, we can write $|f^*| = \sum_{e\in E(S^*, T^*)} f^*(e) - \sum_{e\in E(T^*, S^*)} f^*(e)$.

In fact, we have $f^*(e) = c(e)$ for every $e \in E(S^*,T^*)$. (Check Figure 4, where
$E(S^*,T^*) = \{(s,a),(b,t)\}$.) Why? Suppose conversely that $f^*(e) < c(e)$.
Assume that $e = (u,v)$; the fact that $e = (u,v) \in E(S^*,T^*)$
means that $u \in S^*$ and $v \in T^*$. According to the way the residual graph is constructed, in $G_{f^*}$, there will be
a forward edge $(u,v)$. Consequently, $s$ can reach $v$ in $G_{f^*}$, as $s$ can reach $u$~(because $u\in S^*$) and $u$ can reach 
$v$ following this forward edge. This contradicts to the fact that $v \in T^*$.

Also, we can show that $f^*(e) = 0$ for every $e \in E(T^*,S^*)$. (Check Figure 4, where $E(T^*,S^*) = \{(a,b)\}$.)
Why? Suppose conversely that $f^*(e)>0$. Assume that $e=(u,v)$; the fact that $e=(u,v) \in E(T^*,S^*)$ means
that $u \in T^*$ and $v\in S^*$. Then in the residual graph $G_{f^*}$, there will be a backward edge 
$(v, u)$. Consequently, $s$ can reach $u$ in $G_{f^*}$, as $s$ can reach $v$~(because $v\in S^*$) and $v$ can reach $u$ following this backward edge. 
This contradicts to the fact that $u \in T^*$.

Combining all above, we have 
$|f^*| = \sum_{e\in E(S^*, T^*)} f^*(e) - \sum_{e\in E(T^*, S^*)} f^*(e)
 = \sum_{e\in E(S^*, T^*)} c(e) - 0 = c(S^*, T^*)$.

This proves that $f^*$ is a maximum-flow and $(S^*,T^*)$ is a minimum cut, i.e., the
FF algorithm is optimal, and a minimum-cut can be constructed from the residual
graph. It also completes the connection between the maximum-flow problem and
the minimum-cut problem: for any network, the value of the maximum-flow
always equal to the capacity of the minimum-cut. This is called the max-flow
min-cut theorem.
