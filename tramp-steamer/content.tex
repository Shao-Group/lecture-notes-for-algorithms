\section{Tramp Steamer Problem}

\subsection*{Problem Description}

This is about exercise 4.22, on page 125 of textbook~(read it for a real-world application from which the formulation below is abstracted).
Formally, we are given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$,
where each vertex $v\in V$ is associated with a \emph{profit} $p(v) > 0$,
and each edge $e\in E$ is associated with a \emph{cost} $c(e) > 0$,
and we seek a simple~(i.e., each vertex appears at most once) cycle $C$ of $G$
such that the profit-cost ratio of $C$, defined as $r(C) := (\sum_{v\in C} p(v)) / (\sum_{e\in C} c(e))$
is maximized.

Let $r^* = \max_{C} r(C)$ be the maximized ratio, 
and let $C^* = \arg\max_{C} r(C)$ be the corresponding optimal cycle.
In fact, it's hard to calculate the optimal solution~(i.e., $C^*$ and $r^*$).
Instead, we will approximate it, but with \emph{any given accuracy}.
Specifically, for any given $\epsilon > 0$~(note: $\epsilon$ can be arbitrarily small),
we will determine a cycle $C$ such that $r(C) < r^* \le r(C) + \epsilon$.
In other words, we seek an interval of length $\epsilon$ that contains the optimal ratio.

\subsection*{Binary Search}

We will use \emph{binary search} to solve above problem. To do it, we need two components:
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An algorithm to decide if a given ratio $r$ is a lower bound of $r^*$~(i.e., $r < r^*$). 
In other words, to decide if $r$ is achievable~(i.e., if there exists a cycle $C$ such that $r(C) > r$).
We will design this algorithm; its interface will be decide-lower-bound~($G$, $r$), which
returns true if $r < r^*$ and returns false if $r \ge r^*$.
\item Initial bounds $r_1$ and $r_2$ for $r^*$ to start search from, i.e., $r_1 < r^* \le r_2$.
\end{enumerate}

We will resolve about two components later on. Suppose they are available, we can design the following binary
search algorithm. This algorithm, called binaray-search~($G$, $a$, $b$), is recursive.
Whenever it is called, it is guaranteed that $a < r^* \le b$.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {6}{Algorithm binary-search~($G = (V, E)$, $a$, $b$)}\xxx
	\aab {if $b - a \le \epsilon$: report interval $(a,b]$ and exit;}\xxx
	\aab {let $m = (a + b) / 2$;}\xxx
	\aab {let $z$ = decide-lower-bound~($G$, $m$);}\xxx
	\aab {if $z$ = true: return binary-search~($G$, $m$, $b$);}\xxx
	\aab {else: return binary-search~($G$, $a$, $m$);}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

With available bounds $r_1$ and $r_2$, we can call binary-search~($G$, $r_1$, $r_2$), which will return
the desired interval of length at most $\epsilon$ that includes $r^*$.


\subsection*{Algorithm to Decide Lower Bound}

We now design an algorithm to decide if a given ratio $r$ is a lower bound of $r^*$.
Note that $r < r^*$ if and only if there exists a cycle $C$ such that $r(C) > r$.
(Proof: if $r < r^*$, then the optimal cycle $C^*$ satisfies that $r^* = r(C^*) > r$ and hence such $C = C^*$ exists;
if there exists $r(C) > r$ then $r^* \ge r(C) > r$.)

We can write
\begin{eqnarray*}
& & r < r^* \\
& \Longleftrightarrow & \exists \textrm{ cycle } C \textrm{ s.t.\ } \textstyle r(C) = (\sum_{v\in C} p(v)) / (\sum_{e\in C} c(e)) > r \\
& \Longleftrightarrow & \exists \textrm{ cycle } C \textrm{ s.t.\ } \textstyle r\cdot \sum_{e\in C} c(e) - \sum_{v\in C} p(v) < 0\\
& \Longleftrightarrow & \exists \textrm{ cycle } C \textrm{ s.t.\ } \textstyle \sum_{e\in C} r\cdot c(e) + \sum_{v\in C} (-p(v)) < 0
\end{eqnarray*}

We transform the problem of deciding the last condition into the problem of deciding negative-cycle.
Given $G = (V, E)$ and $r$, we build a new graph $G_1 = (V_1, V_2)$. See Figure~\ref{fig:cycle}.
Each vertex $v$ in $G$ will be replaced by two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ in $G_1$, and $v_1$ and $v_2$ will be connected by an new
edge $(v_1, v_2)$; this new edge will have a length of $-p(v)$. 
Each edge $e = (u,v)$ in $G$ will be replaced by edge $(u_2, v_1)$ in $G_1$; this edge will have a length of $r\cdot c(e)$.
Clearly, based on how $G_1$ is constructed, we have:
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item There exists a cycle $u \to v \to w \to \cdots \to u$ if and only if there exists a cycle $u_2 \to v_1 \to v_2 \to w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to u_1 \to u_2$ in $G_1$.
\item Let $C$ be a cycle in $G$ and let $C_1$ be its corresponding cycle in $G_1$. Then the length of $C_1$ in $G_1$ is 
exactly $\sum_{e\in C} r\cdot c(e) + \sum_{v\in C} (-p(v))$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{cycle}}
\vspace{-2.6cm}
\caption{Constructing $G_1$ from $G$ and $r$.}
\label{fig:cycle}
\end{figure}


Hence, we can keep writing above reasoning:
\begin{eqnarray*}
& & r < r^* \\
& \Longleftrightarrow & \exists \textrm{ cycle } C \textrm{ in $G$ s.t.\ } \textstyle \sum_{e\in C} r\cdot c(e) + \sum_{v\in C} (-p(v)) < 0 \\
& \Longleftrightarrow & \exists \textrm{ cycle } C_1 \textrm{ in $G_1$ s.t.\ the length of $C_1$ is smaller than 0 } \\
& \Longleftrightarrow & \textrm{ $G_1$ contains negative cycle } \\
\end{eqnarray*}

We therefore successfully transformed the problem of deciding if $r < r^*$ into a problem of deciding if $G_1$ contains negative cycle,
which we know how to solve.
The pseudo-code is given below.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {5}{Algorithm decide-lower-bound~($G = (V, E)$, $r$)}\xxx
	\aab {build $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$;}\xxx
	\aab {call an algorithm to decide if $G_1$ contains negative cycle;}\xxx
	\aab {if $G_1$ contains negative cycle: return true~(i.e., $r < r^*$);}\xxx
	\aab {else: return false~(i.e., $r \ge r^*$);}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

The running time of above algorithm is dominated by the procedure of deciding negativ cycles, which is $O(|V_1|\cdot |E_1|)$.
Notice that $|V_1| = 2|V|$ and $|E_1| = |V| + |E|$. Hence, the running time of above algorithm is $O(|V|^2 + |V| \cdot |E|)$.


\subsection*{Initial Bounds}

We now find an initial bounds $r_1$ and $r_2$ for $r^*$.
We can use a trivial lower bound, i.e., $r_1 = 0$.
What is a possible upper bound of $r^*$?
Notice that $r(C)$ is the ratio of the sum of vertex-profits and the sum of edge-costs,
and the number of vertices and the number of edges in a cycle are the same.
Hence, we have an upper bound: $r_2 = \max_{v\in V} p(v) / \max_{e\in E} c(e)$.
A better upper bound can be obtained by realizing that in any cycle edge $e = (u,v)$ is always followed by vertex $v$.
Hence, we have a better bound: $r_2 = \max_{e = (u,v) \in E} p(v) / c(e)$.

\subsection*{Running Time Analysis}

To see the running time, assume $t$ is the number of iterations in the binary search.
We have $(r_2 - r_1) / 2^t = \epsilon$. Hence we have $t = \log (r_2 / \epsilon)$.
The overall running time is therefore $O(\log (r_2 / \epsilon) (|V|^2 + |V||E|))$.
Notice that this running time is a function of $\epsilon$, as expected.
Notice too, that this running time involves numeric value, i.e., $r_2 / \epsilon$.
The \emph{input-size} of any numeric value $x$ is $\log x$.
Therefore $\log(r_2 / \epsilon)$ is linear in the input-size of $r_2/\epsilon$.
Hence, the entire algorithm runs in polynomial-time.

To comapre, consider the linear-search algorithm given below.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {5}{Algorithm linear-search~($G = (V, E)$, $a$, $b$)}\xxx
	\aab {init $r = 0$;}\xxx
	\aab {let $z$ = decide-lower-bound~($G$, $r$);}\xxx
	\aab {if $z$ = true: $r = r + \epsilon$;}\xxx
	\aab {else: return $(r - \epsilon, r]$;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

This algorithm is correct, but it may call decide-lower-bound $r_2 / \epsilon$ times.
So its overall running time is $O(r_2 / \epsilon (|V|^2 + |V||E|))$.
This is \emph{not} a polynomial-time algorithm,
as $r_2 / \epsilon$ is exponential in its input-size, which is $\log(r_2/\epsilon)$.

In conclusion, binary-search is essential to achieve an efficient algorithm for this problem.

\subsection*{Finding A Negative Cycle}

We know how to extend DP or BF algorithms to decide the existence of a negative cycle.
If it exists, how to actually find one?
Again, we can use the shortest-path graph, i.e., $G' = (V, \{(prev[v], v) \mid v\in V\})$ constructed
from the $prev$ array. Note, this $prev$ array is associated with the row-$|V|$ in the DP algorithm,
or associated with the $|V|$-th iterations of the BF algorithm.
We can prove that, if $G$ contains negative cycle, then this graph $G'$ must contain cycle,
and any cycle in $G'$ must be a negative cycle of $G$. See an example below.
