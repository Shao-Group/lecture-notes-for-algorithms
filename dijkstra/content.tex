\section{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

We now study the single-source shortest path problem with positive edge length:
given graph $G = (V, E)$ with edge length $l(e) > 0$ for any $e\in E$ and
source vertex $s\in V$, to seek $distance(s, v)$ for any $v\in V$.
We solve this problem with the \emph{Dijkstra's algorithm}.

Similar to BFS, the idea of Dijkstra's algorithm is also to
determine and calculate the distance of each vertex
in increasing order of distance.
More specifically, let $(v_1^*, v_2^*, \cdots, v_n^*)$, $n = |V|$,
be the order of vertices with increasing distance, i.e., $distance(s, v_k^*) \le distance(s, v_{k+1}^*)$, $1\le k < n$.
In other words, we define $v_k^*$ as the $k$-th closest vertex from $s$.
We don't know this order in advance.
But Dijktra's algorithm will identify vertices in this order and calculate
their distance.
For the sake of writing and notations, we define $R_k = \{v_1^*, v_2^*, \cdots, v_k^*\}$, i.e., 
the first $k$ vertices in above list; $R_k$ are also the closest $k$ vertices from $s$.

Clearly, $v_1^* = s$, $distance(s, v_1^*) = distance(s, s) = 0$, and $R_1 = \{s\}$.
The key question is: given $R_k$~(i.e., the closest $k$ vertices from $s$) and their distances~(i.e., $distance(s, v)$ for every $v\in R_k$),
how to find $v_{k + 1}^*$?
Below we show that $v_{k + 1}^*$ must be within \emph{one-edge extension} of $R_k$.
\begin{claim}
There must exist vertex $u\in R_k$ such that $(u, v_{k+1}^*) \in E$.
\end{claim}
\emph{Proof.} Suppose conversely that for every $u\in R_k$ we have $(u, v_{k+1}^k)\not\in E$.
Consider the shortest path from $s$ to $v_{k+1}^*$.
Let $w$ be the vertex right before $v_{k+1}^*$ in path $p$, i.e, $(w, v_{k+1}^*)$ is the last edge of $p$.
We have $distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) = distance(s, w) + l(w, v_{k+1}^*)$. %following the optimal substructure property.
As edges have positive edge length, we have $l(w, v_{k+1}^*) > 0$, and consequently
$distance(s, w) < distance(s, v_{k+1}^*)$.
Besides, according to the assumption, we have $w\not\in R_k$.
Therefore, $v_{k+1}^*$ cannot be the $(k+1)$-th closest vertex from $s$,
because $w$ has a shorter distance than $v_{k+1}^*$. This contradicts to the definition of $v_{k+1}^*$.\qed

Note that, in above proof, we use the fact that edges have positive lengths.
Hence, above claim may not be true for graphs with negative edge length.
This also explains why Dijkstra's algorithm won't work for graphs with negative edge length.


The above claim shows that, the last edge $(u,v)$ of the shortest path from $s$ to $v_{k+1}^*$
satisfies that $u\in R_k$ and $v\not\in R_k$. Which such edge is the correct one?
We don't know, so we enumerate all such edges $(u,v)\in E$ with $u\in R_k$ and $v\not\in R_k$.
Suppose that $(u,v)$ is the last edge of the shortest path from $s$ to $v_{k+1}^*$,
%then following the optimal substructure property,
we know that $distance(s,v) = distance(s,u) + l(u,v)$.
This leads to the following formula to calculate $v_{k+1}^*$ and its predecessor in the shortest path.
See an example in Figure~\ref{fig:extension}.


\begin{corollary} \label{cor1}
We have 
$$distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) = \textstyle \min_{u\in R_k, v\in V \setminus R_k, (u, v)\in E} (distance(s, u) + l(u,v)).$$
Let $(u',v')$ be the optimal edge in the minimization, i.e.,
$$(u',v') := \textstyle \arg\min_{u\in R_k, v\in V \setminus R_k, (u, v)\in E} (distance(s, u) + l(u,v)).$$
Then $v_{k+1}^* = v'$ and $u'$ is the predecessor of $v_{k+1}^*$ in the shortest path from $s$ to $v_{k+1}^*$.
\end{corollary}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{extension}}
\caption{Example for Colollary~1. Suppose that we know $R_5 = \{s, a, d, e, f\}$ and their distances from $s$, marked next to vertices.
To find $v_6^*$ and calculate $distance(s,v_6^*)$, we consider all one-edge extension of $R_5$, marked as thick blue edges.
Following Corollary~1, $distance(s, v_6^*) = \min_{u\in R_5, v\not\in R_5, (u,v)\in E} (distance(s,u) + l(u,v)) = \min\{6 + 2, 3 + 10, 3 + 4, 9 + 5, 9 + 8\} = 7$,
and the optimal edge is $(d,c)$. Hence, $v_6^* = c$ and $d$ is the predecessor of $d$ in the shortest path.  }
\label{fig:extension}
\end{figure}


%Above Corollary offers a framework of Dijkstra's algorithm by sequentially calculating $v_k^*$ and $distance~(s, v_k^*)$ for $k = 1, 2, \cdots, n$.
%We will show details in realizing this framework by using efficient data structures.
We therefore have the following algorithm~(framework), in which we follow above formula
to iteratively construct $R_k$, $k = 1, 2, \cdots, n$.
We again use array $dist$ of size $n$ to store the distance for vertices in $R_k$.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {8}{Algorithm Dijkstra-Framework~($G = (V, E), s \in V$)}\xxx

	\aac {$dist[v'] = dist[u'] + l(u',v')$;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

A naive implementation of above framework takes $O(|V|\cdot|E|)$ time,
as for each $k$, the calculation of the minimization may take $O(|E|)$ time.
Next lecture, we will show how to use efficient data structures to speed up,
leading to the complete Dijkstra's algorithm with improved running time.

We rewrite the formula in Corollary~1~(last Lecture) into an equivalent form by separating the minimization into two levels:
$$distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) = \textstyle \min_{v\in V\setminus R_k} \min_{u\in R_k, (u, v)\in E} (distance(s, u) + l(u,v)).$$
Now we define the inner level of minimization with a new term $dist_k(v)$:
$$dist_k(v) := \textstyle \min_{u\in R_k, (u, v)\in E} (distance(s, u) + l(u,v)).$$
Then we have 
$$distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) = \textstyle \min_{v\in V\setminus R_k} dist_k(v).$$
Intuitively, $dist_k(v)$ gives the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ by only using vertices in $R_k$.

Try above formulas in Figure~\ref{fig:extension}.
Answer: $dist_5(b) = \min\{8, 13\} = 8$, $dist_5(c) = \min\{7, 14\} = 7$, $dist_5(h) = 17$, $dist_5(k) = \infty$, $dist_5(j) = \infty$;
hence $v_6^* = c$ and $distance(s,v_6^*) = dist_5(c) = 7$.

%%hence $v_6^* = c$ and $distance(s,v_6^*) = dist_5(c) = 7$.}

%%\end{figure}

With $dist_k$ available, the next closest vertex, i.e., $v_{k+1}^*$ can be easily calculated
by picking the one with smallest $dist_k$ value.
More importantly, we can design a more efficient procedure
to calculate $dist_{k+1}$ in the next iteration by largely reusing $dist_k$.
To see that, recall its definition, for any $v\in V\setminus R_{k+1}$, we have 
$$dist_{k+1}(v) = \textstyle \min_{u\in R_{k+1}, (u, v)\in E} (distance(s, u) + l(u,v)).$$
Note that $R_{k+1} = R_k \cup \{v_{k+1}^*\}$. Hence
\begin{displaymath}
dist_{k+1}(v) = \left\{
\begin{array}{llllll}
\min\{ dist_k(v), distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) + l(v_{k+1}^*, v) \} & \textrm{ if } & (v_{k+1}^*, v) \in E \\
dist_k(v) & \textrm{ if } & (v_{k+1}^*, v) \not\in E
\end{array}
\right.
\end{displaymath}
In other words, when calculating $dist_{k+1}$, we only need to examine the out-edges of $v_{k+1}^*$
and update only if the use of $v_{k+1}^*$ leads to a shorter path. The pseudo-code of
calculating $dist_{k+1}$ from $dist_k$ is given below.
Before calling this updating procedure, $dist_{k+1}$ is first copied from $dist_k$.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {6}{procedure update-dist~($dist_k, v_{k+1}^*$)}\xxx
	\aaB {4}{for $(v_{k+1}^*, v) \in E$}\xxx
	\aaC {2}{if~($dist_k(v) > distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) + l(v_{k+1}^*, v)$)}\xxx
	\aad {$dist_{k+1}(v) = distance(s, v_{k+1}^*) + l(v_{k+1}^*, v)$;}\xxx
	\aac {end if;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end procedure;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

Try above procedure with the example below.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{update}}
\caption{Following Figure~\ref{fig:extension}, we have that $v_6^* = c$.
We now want to calculate $dist_6$ using $dist_5$. We consider the out-edges of $c$, marked as thick blue edges.
Eventually, $dist_6(b) = 8$, $dist_6(h) = 13$, $dist_6(k) = \infty$, and $dist_6(j) = 10$.  }
\label{fig:update}
\end{figure}

The above procedure enables fast calculation of $dist_k$.
The last piece of Dijkstra's algorithm comes with the use of \emph{priority queue}
to quickly pick the next closest vertex, i.e., to calculate $v_{k+1}^* = \arg\min_{v\in V\setminus R_k} dist_k(v)$.
To this end, the priority queue $PQ$ always stores $V\setminus R_k$,
and for each vertex $v$ that is stored in $PQ$, its priority is $dist_k(v)$.
In this way, every time we call find-min~($PQ$), it gives us $\min_{v\in V\setminus R_k} dist_k(v)$.
In the complete Dijkstra's algorithm, we don't need to implicitly maintain $R_k$,
as $PQ$ is always complement to $R_k$.
In order to maintain this invariant, we delete $v_{k+1}^*$ from $PQ$, by calling delete-min, at the time of adding $v_{k+1}^*$ to $R_{k+1}$.
In order to guarantee that the priority of $v$ is always $dist_k(v)$,
we call decrease-key every time we update $dist_k$ of a vertex.

\end{minipage}

The pseudo-code for complete Dijkstra's algorithm is given above.
We use array $dist$ of size $n$ to store $dist_k$.
Where are the distances for those vertices in $R_k$~(i.e., those are not in $PQ$) stored?
They are in array $dist$ as well.
This is because, at the time $v_{k+1}^*$ is identified and added to $R_{k+1}$~(i.e., removed from $PQ$),
$dist_k$ value for this vertex is exactly its distance.
In fact, at any time of the algorithm, $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$ for any vertex $v$ that is not in $PQ$.
Finally, the algorithm don't explicitly maintain an index $k$: this index implicitly increases in every iteration of the while loop.


Here are some facts about Dijkstra's algorithm.
First, $dist[v]$ is always an upper bound of the distance.
\begin{fact} \label{dijk-fact1}
At any time of the algorithm, $dist[v] \ge distance(s,v)$.
\end{fact}

This is because, by definition, $dist_k(v)$ is the length of 
shortest path from $s$ to $v$ using only vertices in $R_k$.
In other words, $dist_k(v)$ represents the length of the optimal
path of a subset~(of all possible paths from $s$ to $v$).

Second, once $v$ is removed from $PQ$, $dist[v]$ won't change and remain as $distance(s,v)$.
\begin{fact}
At any time of the algorithm, if $v$ is not in $PQ$, then $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$.
\end{fact}
This is because, at the time $v$ is deleted from $PQ$, $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$.
Following Fact~\ref{dijk-fact1}, it will remain this minimized value.
Notice though, in Dijkstra's algorithm, a vertex $v$ not in $PQ$ might be ``touched''
by an edge $(v^*_{k+1}, v)$, where $v^*_{k+1}$ is the newly determined closest vertex,
   but the actual update will not happen.
See an example in Figure~2 of Lecture 17, edge~$(c, e)$.
%Such ``attempts'' to reduce $dist[v]$ will always fail.

The running time of Dijkstra's algorithmd depends on the specific implementation of priority queue used.
Consider using binary heap. The break-down of running time is given below.
Note that each vertex will be picked from the $PQ$ at most once and each edge will be examined at most once~(for directed graph) or at most twice~(for undirected graph).
The total running time is $\Theta((|V|+|E|)\log |V|)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item initialization: $\Theta(|V|)$;
\item insert~($PQ$): $|V| \times \Theta(\log |V|)$;
\item empty~($PQ$): $|V| \times \Theta(1)$;
\item find-min~($PQ$): $|V| \times \Theta(1)$;
\item delete-min~($PQ$): $|V| \times \Theta(\log |V|)$;
