\section{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to solve the (single-source) shortest path problem with negative edge length,
and its extension can also be used to detect if a graph contains negative cycle~(reachable from the given source).

Bellman-Ford algorithm is quite simple. It only maintain an array, 
$dist$ of size $|V|$, as its data structure. And it just does a bunch of ``update'' operations.
An ``update'' function takes an edge $e = (u,v)$ as input, and updates $dist[v]$ as $dist[u] + l(u,v)$ if
the former is larger than the latter.  

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {4}{procedure update(edge $(u,v)\in E$)}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{if~($dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v)$)}\xxx
	\aac {$dist[v] = dist[u] + l(u,v)$;}\xxx
%	\aac {\textcolor{black}{$prev[v]= u$};}\xxx
	\aab {end if;}\xxx
	\aaa {end procedure;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


Bellman-Ford algorithm iterates $(|V| - 1)$ rounds, and in each round, updates \emph{all} edges, in an arbitrary order.
%If the given $G$ does contain negative cycle reachable from given $s$, when the algorithm terminates, we will have that $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$ for every $v\in V$. 

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}

	\aab {end for;}\xxx
%	\aab {report: $dist[v]$ gives $distance(s,v)$, for any $v\in V$;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


See two examples of running Bellman-Ford algorithm below.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{example2}}
\caption{The dist array~(after each round) running Bellman-Ford algorithm on each example.
In each round, we choose to update all edges in lexicographic order, i.e., $(a,b), (a,c), (c,b),(c,s),(s,a)$.}
\end{figure}


Since update function takes constant time, clearly, Bellman-Ford algorithm runs in $\Theta(|V| \cdot |E|)$ time.

To prove the correctness of Bellman-Ford algorithm,
we first introduce some definitions and prove some properties.

A negative cycle $C$ in a graph is a cycle with negative length, i.e., $l(C) := \sum_{e\in C} l(e) < 0$.
In the presence of negative cycle, if we do not limit the number of edges
in a path, then the length of a path could goes to negative infinity.
In other words, the shortest path may not exist in graphs with negative cycles.
We therefore need to be careful when talking about shortest paths or $distance(\cdot, \cdot)$,
as they have to exist first. It suffices to require the graph to be negative cycle free.
Later in this Lecture we will
also introduce an algorithm to detect if a given graph contains negative cycle or not.

A path $p$ in a graph is \emph{simple} if $p$ does not have repeating vertices.
If a graph $G$ does not contain negative cycle, then 
for any pair of vertices $u$ and $v$, if $u$ can reach $v$,
then there always exists a {simple} shortest path from $u$ to $v$,
as otherwise we can skip the cycle in it to get a better or same-length path.
If all cycles in graph $G$ are positive then every shortest path is simple.
Since any simple path contains at most $|V| - 1$ edges, we have the following:

\begin{fact}
If $G$ does not contain negative cycles, for every $u,v\in V$ where $v$ is reachable from $u$, 
there exists a shortest path from $u$ to $v$ with at most $(|V| - 1)$ edges.
\end{fact}

Shortest path admits the following \emph{optimal substructure} property.
Intuitively, this property states that, the shortest path from $u$ to $v$
contains the shortest path from $u$ to any internal vertex on this path~(formally described below).
Essentially, this is why shortest path problem can be solved efficiently.

\begin{fact}
%Let $p = (v_1, v_2) \to (v_2, v_3) \to \cdots \to (v_{k-1}, v_k)$
Let $p = v_1 \to v_2 \to v_3 \to \cdots \to v_{k-1} \to v_k$
be the shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_k$.
Then for any $1\le i \le k$,
$p_i = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to  v_i$,
%$p_i := (v_1, v_2) \to (v_2, v_3) \to \cdots \to (v_{i-1}, v_i)$, 
i.e., the portion of $p$ from $v_1$ to $v_i$,
is the shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_i$.
\end{fact}

\emph{Proof.} Suppose that 
$p_i = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_i$
%$p_i = (v_1, v_2) \to (v_2, v_3) \to \cdots \to (v_{i-1}, v_i)$
is not the shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_i$. Assume that
$q$ is the shorest path from $v_1$ to $v_i$.
Then we can construct a path from $v_1$ to $v_k$ shorter than $p$,
by concatenating $q$ and $v_i \to v_{i+1} \to \cdots \to v_k$.
This contradicts to the fact that $p$ is the shortest path from $v_1$ to $v_k$.\qed

%Note that the above property holds even for graphs with negative edge length~(as the proof does not assume anything about edge length).
The above fact immediately implies the following:

\begin{fact}
If there exists one shortest path from $s$ to $v$ such that $(u,v)$ is the last edge
on this shortest path, then we have that $distanct(s,v) = distance(s,u) + l(u,v)$.
\end{fact}

Now let's go back to the Bellman-Ford algorithm. 
We first show an invariant about its data structure the $dist$ array: 

\begin{fact}
\label{fact1}
Throughout the Bellman-Ford algorithm, if $dist[v] \neq \infty$ then $dist[v]$ represents the length of some path from $s$ to $v$.
\end{fact}

\emph{Proof.} Clearly, in the initialization step which sets $dist[s] = 0$ and $dist[v] = \infty$ for all $v\neq s$, above claim holds,
as $dist[s]$ stores a path from $s$ to $s$ without any edge and therefore its length is 0.
Now to show above fact is correct throughout the algorithm, we just need to show that the ``update'' operation keeps
this invariant~(as this algorithm does nothing else but ``update'').
%\begin{fact}
%\label{fact2}
%The update operation keeps the invariant that $dist[v]$ represents the length of some path from $s$ to $v$ when $dist[v] \neq \infty$, i.e., $dist[v] \ge distance(s,v)$, for every $v\in V$.
%\end{fact}
%\emph{Proof.} 
We can prove this by induction. % w.r.t.\ the sequence of update operations. 
Assume that up to the $n$-th update opertion
above claim holds, i.e., $dist[v]$ stores the length of some path from $s$ to $v$ when $dist[v] \neq \infty$.
Now consider the $(n+1)$-th update operation on edge $e = (u,v)$. Assume that $dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v)$, as otherwise this operation does not change $dist$ 
and the claim continues to be true.
Now $dist[v]$ is updated as $dist[u] + l(u,v)$. Since, according to the inductive assumption, $dist[u]$ stores the length of some path from $s$ to $u$,
we have that $dist[v]$ stores the length of the path that consists of the aforementioned path from $s$ to $u$ followed by edge $(u,v)$. \qed

Assume that the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ exists. 
Following above fact, $dist[v] \ge distance(s,v)$ throughout the algorithm, as $dist[v]$ 
represents the length of \emph{some} path from $s$ to $v$, while $distance(s,v)$ represents the
length of the \emph{shortest} path from $s$ to $v$.
In Bellman-Ford algorithm, $dist[v]$ starts from a trivial upper bound~(i.e., infinity) of $distance(s,v)$,
and will get closer and closer to $distance(s,v)$ through updates,
and eventually reach $distance(s, v)$.  We now state the conditions for this to happen.

\begin{fact}
\label{fact3}
If edge $(u,v)$ is the last edge on one shortest path from $s$ to $v$ and $dist[u] = distance(s,u)$, then after $update(u,v)$ we will have $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$.
\end{fact}
\emph{Proof.} Since edge $(u,v)$ is the last edge on one shortest path from $s$ to $v$, according to Fact~3, we know that
$distance(s,v) = distance(s,u) + l(u,v) = dist[u] + l(u,v)$. Through $update(u,v)$, $dist[v]$ will be compared with $dist[u] + l(u,v) = distance(s,v)$.
The first case will be that $dist[v] \le dist[u] + l(u,v) = distance(s,v)$. Notice that in this case we must have 
$dist[v] = distance(s,v)$ according to Fact~\ref{fact1}, i.e., $dist[v]$ already stores the distance.
The second case will be that $dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v) = distance(s,v)$, and in this case the ``update'' function
will set $dist[v] = dist[u] + l(u,v) = distance(s,v)$. 
Hence, in either case, we will have $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$ after updating edge $(u,v)$.\qed


Suppose that $s \to v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v$ is one shortest path from $s$ to $v$.
In the initialization step we have $dist[s] = distance(s,s) = 0$. 
If at a later time, $update(s, v_1)$ is executed, then following above Fact~\ref{fact3}, 
we know that $dist[v_1] = distance(s, v_1)$ after this update~(reasoning: $dist[s] = distance(s,s)$,
and $(s,v_1)$ is the last edge on one shortest path from $s$ to $v_1$ according to the optimal substrcture property).
Once $dist[v_1]$ becomes $distance(s,v_1)$, $dist[v_1]$ will stay as $distance(s,v_1)$ according to Fact~\ref{fact1}.
If at a later time $update(v_1, v_2)$ happens 
then following Fact~\ref{fact3}, we have that $dist[v_2] = distance(s, v_2)$.
Note that it does not matter if additional updates happen between $update(s, v_1)$ and $update(v_1, v_2)$.
We can continue this argument; a general form is summarized below.

\begin{fact}
\label{fact4}
If there exists a sequence of udpate procedures~(not necessarily consecutive,
i.e., there can be update(s) between any two in this sequence) that update all the edges following one shortest path
from $s$ to $v$, then after that we will have $dist[v] = distance(s, v)$.
\end{fact}

But we do not know the the shortest path in advance. That's fine.
As in graphs without negative cycles the number of edges in the (simple) shortest path will not exceed $(|V| - 1)$, the Bellman-Ford algorithm
simply update \emph{all} edges in each round, and do this $(|V| - 1)$ times.
This therefore guarantees that the $i$-th edge on the shortest path can be updated during the $i$-th round.
Consequently, this guarantees the existence of a sequence of update procedures that update all edges following the shortest path.
This analysis leads to the following conclusion, which proves the correctness of Bellman-Ford algorithm.
See an illustration in Figure~\ref{fig:bellman}.
\begin{fact}
\label{fact5}
If $G$ does not contain negative cycle,  then we have $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$ for every $v\in V$ after $|V| -1$ rounds of updates.
In particular, let $p$ be one shortest path from $s$ to $v$ with $k$ edges.  
Then after $k$ rounds of updates, $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$.
\end{fact}

\subsection*{Detecting Negative Cycles}

We can slightly modify Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect if a given graph contains negative cycle that is reachable from $s$.
The algorithm does one more round of updates, in which it determines if some $dist$ value can be further reduced.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {12}{Algorithm Bellman-Ford-Detect-Negative-Cycle~($G = (V, E)$, $l(e)$ for any $e\in E$, $s \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {init an array $dist$ of size $|V|$;}\xxx
	\aab {$dist[s] = 0$; $dist[v] = \infty$ for any $v\neq s$;}\xxx
%	\aab {\textcolor{black}{$prev[v] = null$, for any $v\in V$};}\xxx
	\aaB {4}{for $k = 1 \to |V| - 1$}\xxx
	\aaC {2}{for each edge $(u,v)\in E$}\xxx
	\aad {$update(u,v)$;}\xxx
	\aac {end for;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{for each edge $(u,v)\in E$}\xxx
	\aac {if~($dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v)$): report $G$ contains negative cycle and exit}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aab {report that $G$ does not contain negative cycle}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


Let's show that above algorithm is correct.
We first prove that, if $G$ does not contain negative cycle~(reachable from $s$), then in above additional round $dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v)$ will never happen,
i.e., we will get the report that ``$G$ does not contain negative cycle''.
As per Fact~\ref{fact5} and the assumption that $G$ does not contain negative
cycle, we know that $dist[v] = distance(s,v)$ after $|V| -1 $ rounds.  Also,
	according to Fact~\ref{fact1}, update function will never make $dist[v]$
	smaller than $distance(s,v)$ when $G$ does not contain negative cycle.
	Hence, during the $|V|$-th round in above algorithm, none of the $dist$
	value can be further reduced.

We then prove that, if $G$ contains negaive cycle~(reachable from $s$), then in above additional round, there must exist an edge $(u,v)$ such that $dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v)$.
Suppose conversely that, in above additional round, all edges satisfy $dist[v] \le dist[u] + l(u,v)$.
Let $C = v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v_{k-1} \to v_k \to v_1$ be one negative reachable from $s$.  We have $\sum_{e\in C} l(e) < 0$ as $C$ is a nagative cycle.
Applying $dist[v] \le dist[u] + l(u,v)$ to all edges in $C$ gives:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{llllllllllllll}
	dist[v_2] & \le & dist[v_1] + l(v_1, v_2) \\
	dist[v_3] & \le & dist[v_2] + l(v_2, v_3) \\
	& \cdots & \\
	dist[v_k] & \le & dist[v_{k-1}] + l(v_{k-1}, v_k) \\
	dist[v_1] & \le & dist[v_{k}] + l(v_{k}, v_1)
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}

Summing up both sides of all above inequalities gives $\sum_{e\in C} l(e) \ge 0$, a contradiction.


\subsection*{Shortest Path of DAGs}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a DAG with possibly negative edge length $c(e)$ for each $e\in E$.
We want to find the distance from a given source $s$ to each vertex $v\in V$.
Note that $G$ does not contain negative cycles simply because $G$ does not contain any cycle.
We can design a simplified version of Bellman-Ford algorithm to solve this problem.
In particular, we only need to do one round of ``update''~(instead of $|V|-1$ rounds as in Bellman-Ford algorithm).
But, the edges cannot be updated in a arbitrary order. In fact,
we first need to find a linearization of $G$~(recall that a directed graph can be linearized if and only if it is a DAG),
and then update the in-edges of vertices following this linearization.

%%\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
%%	\aaA {5}{procedure update~(edge $(u,v)\in E$)}\xxx
%%	\aaB {3}{if~($dist[v] > dist[u] + l(u,v)$)}\xxx
%%	\aac {$dist[v] = dist[u] + l(u,v)$;}\xxx
%%	\aac {\textcolor{black}{$prev[v]= u$};}\xxx
%%	\aab {end if;}\xxx
%%	\aaa {end procedure;}\xxx
%%\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {9}{Algorithm BF-DAG~(DAG $G = (V, E)$, $l(e)$ for any $e\in E$, $s \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {init array $dist$ of size $|V|$: $dist[s] = 0$; $dist[v] = \infty$ for any $v\neq s$;}\xxx
	\aab {calculate a linearization of $G$;}\xxx
	\aaB {4}{\textcolor{blue}{for $v\in V$ following the order of linearization}}\xxx
	\aaC {2}{for each $(u,v)\in E$;}\xxx
	\aad {$update(u,v)$;}\xxx
	\aac {end for;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aab {for each $v\in V$: report: $distance(s,v) = dist[v]$;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


The correctness of above algorithm for DAGs can also be proved in the same way as in the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
For any vertex $v$, let $p = s \to v_1 \to v_2 \to \cdots \to v$ be one shortest path from $s$ to $v$;
we have proved that~(for Bellman-Ford algorithm), if the run of the algorithm contains a {sequence} of updates 
that sequentially update the edges in this shortest path $p$, then 
$dist[v]$ will be equal to $distance(s,v)$ after these update procedures.
The above algorithm update the in-edges of vertices sequentially following a linearization $X$.
By the definition of linearization, the list of vertices of any path, including $p$, must be a \emph{subsequence} of $X$~(i.e., $s$ is before
$v_1$ in $X$, $v_1$ is before $v_2$ in $X$, etc).
Therefore, edges in $p$ must be updated
sequentially by the above algorithm, i.e., edge $(s, v_1)$ gets updated when processing $v_1$,
edge $(v_1, v_2)$ gets updated when processing $v_2$, and so on. 
See Figure~\ref{fig:dag} for an example.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{dag}}
\caption{Illustration of the correctness of the above algorithm.
Assume $s\to a \to b \to v$ be one shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in $G$.
Then in any linearization of $G$, $s$ is before $a$, $a$ is before $b$, and $b$ is before $v$.
So, edge $(s, a)$ will be updated when processing the in-edges of $a$, 
$(a, b)$ will be updated when processing the in-edges of $b$, 
and $(b, v)$ will be updated when processing the in-edges of $v$.
Therefore, there exists a sequence of updates that sequentially update these 3 edge.  }
