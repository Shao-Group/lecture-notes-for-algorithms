\section{NP-complete and NP-hard}

\subsection*{Polynomial-Time Reduction Revisit}

Polynomial-time reduction can be used in two different ways. Suppose we have $X\le_p Y$.
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If we know an algorithm to solve $Y$, then we know how to solve $X$. In this way
we are making use of an (existing) algorithm for $Y$ to solve a (new) problem $X$. Such an example
is we use the maximum flow problem~(problem $Y$) to solve the bipartite maximum matching problem~(problem $X$).
\item If we know problem $X$ is \emph{hard}, then we know that problem $Y$ is \emph{hard}. 
This is because $X\le_p Y$ means that $Y$ is at least as hard as $X$, as any algorithm of $Y$ can be used to solve $X$.
In this way, we are making use of an (existing) hard problem $X$
to prove that a (new) problem $Y$ is hard.  Below we will formally define ``hard''.
Informally, it means a polynomial-time algorithm does not exist~(unless P{}~$=${}~NP).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{NP-complete}

\begin{definition}[NP-complete]
Let $X$ be a decision problem. We say $X$ is NP-complete, if $X$ is in NP, and for every problem $X'$ in NP, we have $X'\le_p X$.
\end{definition}

NP-complete problems are the ``hardest'' problems in NP. It's not obvious that
NP-complete problems even exist.  
Thanks to the pioneers of computer science: in 1971 Cook and Levin proved the first
NP-complete problem by showing that the circuit satisfiability problem is NP-complete.
This builds the foundation of complexity theory.

One side of application of NP-complete relates to the connection between P and NP.
Clearly, P is a subset of NP, i.e., P{}~$\subset${}~NP.
But is the case that P{}~$\neq${}~NP~(i.e., P is a strict subset of NP),
or P{}~$=${}~NP?  This question remains open,
and is perhap \emph{the} most important open question in computer science.
(It is also one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute.)
The existence of NP-complete problems gives a way to prove that P{}~$=${}~NP, by just showing
one NP-complete problem is polynomial-time solvable. This is easy to understand: NP-complete
problems are the hardest problems in NP; if one of them is polynomial-time solvable,
then every problem must be polynomial-time solvable. We formally state it and prove it below.

\begin{claim}
Let $X$ be a NP-complete problem. If $X$ is in P, then we have P{}~$=${}~NP.
\end{claim}

\emph{Proof.} 	
In order to show P{}~$=${}~NP, we only need to prove NP{}~$\subset${}~P, as we already have P{}~$\subset${}~NP. 
Let $X'$ be an arbitrary problem in NP.  
Since $X$ is NP-complete, by definition, we know that $X'\le_p X$. Because
$X$ is in P, then we have that $X'$ is in P as well~(see Fact~1 in Lecture~40).
This proves that NP{}~$\subset${}~P, as $X'$ is arbitrary.  \qed

Above claims suggests the two possible cases between P, NP, and NPC---here we use ``NPC''
to represent the set of all NP-complete problems. See Figure~\ref{fig:PvsNP}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Two possibilities among P, NP, and NPC.}
\label{fig:PvsNP}
\end{figure}

\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item P{}~$\neq${}~NP. In this case, we must have P{}~$\cap${}~NPC{}~$=\emptyset$. This is
because otherwise, if there exists a problem $X\in \textrm{ P } \cap \textrm{ NPC}$, P will be equal to NP according to above Claim). 
\item P{}~$=${}~NP. In this case, we must have P{}~$=${}~NP{}~$=${}~NPC. 
This is because in this case \emph{any} two problems $X$ and $Y$ in NP~(and therefore in P)
must satisfy that $X\le_p Y$ and $Y\le_p X$, as both $X$ and $Y$ can be solved in polynomial-time.
This proves that every problem in NP is NP-complete.
\end{enumerate}

Another side of application of NP-complete problems is to use existint NP-complete problems
to prove new problems are NP-complete~(i.e., hard). This is based on the following claim.

\begin{claim}
Let $X$ be a problem in NP. If there exists an NP-complete problem $Y$ such that $Y\le_p X$,
we we have $X$ is NP-complete.
\end{claim}

This is easy to understand: $Y$ is NP-complete, i.e., it is (one of) the hardest problem
in NP; of course $Y$ is at least as hard as $X$ because $X$ is in NP.
Now we have $Y\le_p X$, i.e., $X$ is at least as hard as $Y$. Combined, $X$ is (one of) the
hardest problem in NP as well. Below we give a formal proof.

\emph{Proof.} Let $X'$ an arbitrary problem in NP. Since problem $Y$ is NP-complete,
by definition, we have $X' \le_p Y$. Since $Y\le_p X$, we must have that $X'\le X$.
(Here we use the property that the polynomial-time reduction is transitive.)
Combining that $X$ is in NP, we know that $X$ is NP-complete.\qed

Above Claim suggest a procedure to prove that a decision problem $X$ is NP-complete.
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item show that $X$ is in NP;
\item pick an existing NP-complete problem $Y$;
\item show that $Y$ is polynomial-time reducible to $X$. 
\end{enumerate}

Using above procedure, lots of problems have been proved to be NP-complete.
These includes the 3SAT problem, the decision-version of the vertex cover problem, i.e., $VC(G,k)$.
Other well-known NP-complete problems include, the decision-version of independenet set problem,
the Hamiltonian path problem, 
the Hamiltonian cycle problem, 
3D matching problem, $k$-coloring problem when $k\ge 3$, the subset-sum problem, decision-version of TSP~(traveling salesman problems), etc.
Below we give some details for the independent set problem.

\subsection*{The Independent Set Problem}

An \emph{independent set} of an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$
is a subset of vertices $V_1\subset V$ satisfying that no two vertices in it is connected by an edge, i.e.,
for any $u,v\in V_1$, we have $(u,v)\not\in E$. We define two versions of the independent set problem.
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item optimization-version: given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, to seek an independent set $V_1$ of $G$ such that $V_1$ is maximized; we denote this problem as $IS(G)$;
\item decision-version: given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ and integer $k\ge 0$, to decide if there exists an independent set $V_1$ of $G$ such that $|V_1| \ge k$;
we denote this problem as $IS(G,k)$.
\end{enumerate}

There is a simple connection between independent set and vertex cover, stated below. Can you spot why?
See Figure~\ref{fig:is} for an example.

\begin{claim}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. We have $V_1\subset V$ is an independent set of $G$ if and only if $V\setminus V_1$ is a vertex cover of $G$.
\end{claim}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering{\input{is}}
\caption{Relationship between independent set and vertex cover.}
\label{fig:is}
\end{figure}

Above claim immediately suggests the following corollaries.
\begin{corollary}
$V_1^*\subset V$ is one maximum independent set of an undirected graph $G$ if and only if $V\setminus V_1^*$ is one minimum vertex cover of $G$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
$G$ has an independent set with $k$ vertices if and only if $G$ has a vertex cover with $|V|-k$ vertices.
\end{corollary}

According to Corollary~2, we have $VC(G, k) \le_p IS(G, k)$, as we can design an algorithm for $VC(G,k)$ with one statement ``return solver-for-$IS(G,|V|-k)$''.
Note that, this actually proves that $IS(G,k)$ is NP-complete, given that $VC(G,k)$ is NP-complete and $IS(G,k)$ is in NP.
%Symmetrically we have $IS(G,k)\le_p VC(G,k)$.
%Similarly, according to Corollary~1, we can write $IS(G) \le_p VC(G)$ and $VC(G) \le_p IS(G)$.
%Recall that we also proved that $VC(G,k)\le_p VC(G)$ and $VC(G)\le_p VC(G,k)$ in Lecture~41.
%We conclude that all the four problems are equivalent, i.e., any two of them are polynomial-time reducible to each other.

\subsection*{NP-hard}

\begin{definition}[NP-hard]
Let $X$ be a problem. We say $X$ is NP-hard, if there exists an NP-complete problem $Y$ such that $Y\le_p X$.
\end{definition}

Intutively, a problem is said to be NP-hard, if it is at least as hard as the hardest problem in NP~(i.e., an NP-complete problem).
Note that NP-hard problems are not restricted to decision problems. This makes it convinent to use. For examples, 
we can say the (optimization-version of) vertex cover problem is NP-hard,
the (optimization-version of) independent set problem is NP-hard,
the TSP problem is NP-hard, etc.
Of course, all NP-complete problems are also NP-hard. In fact, by definitions, we have

\begin{fact}
NP{}~$\cap${}~NP-hard{}~$=${}~NPC, where we also use ``NP-hard'' to represent the set of all NP-hard problems.
\end{fact}

Above fact suggests the following two possibilities among P, NP, NPC, and NP-hard. See Figure~\ref{fig:nphard}.
