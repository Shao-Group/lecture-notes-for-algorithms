\section{Minimum Spanning Tree}

\subsection*{Tree and Spanning Tree}

A tree is an undirected graph that is connected and acyclic.
(``connected'' here means the graph consists of a single connected component.)
A tree $T = (V, E)$ always satisfies that $|E| = |V| - 1$.
In fact, any two of these three properties~(i.e., connected, acyclic, and $|E| = |V| - 1$)
implies the other one, formally stated below. Play with some examples
to fully understand these properties.

\begin{fact}\label{mst-fact1}
Let $T = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. The following statements are equivalent.
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is a tree.
\item $T$ is connected and acyclic.
\item $|E| = |V| - 1$ and $T$ is acyclic.
\item $|E| = |V| - 1$ and $T$ is connected.
\item There exists an unique path between every pair of vertices of $T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{fact}

Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected graph.
We say tree $T = (V_1, E_1)$ is a \emph{spanning tree}
of $G$ if $V_1 = V$ and $E_1\subset E$.
As $T$ is a tree, clearly we have $|E_1| = |V_1| - 1 = |V| - 1$.
Note that a spanning tree is always w.r.t.\ a graph, i.e., we always
say a spanning tree of a graph. Note too, that for an undirected graph $G$, 
its spanning tree may not be unqiue. See Figure~\ref{fig:mst-spanning}
for an example.  (Think: when an undirected graph has a unique spanning tree?)

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

By above definition, a spanning tree of $G = (V,E)$ is a tree that uses $(|V| - 1)$ edges
of $G$ that connects all vertices of $G$.
Following Fact~\ref{mst-fact1}, we can construct a spanning tree of $G$
in the following two ways:
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item pick $(|V|-1)$ edges of $G$ that are acyclic;
\item pick $(|V|-1)$ edges of $G$ that connects all vertices of $G$;
\end{enumerate}
These two approaches are equivalent but leads to different algorithms
in constructing the minimum spanning tree~(see below).


\subsection*{Minimum Spanning Tree~(MST)}

Now we introduce the minimum spanning tree problem.
Given an directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with \emph{edge weight} $w(e)$ for any $e\in E$,
we seek a spanning tree $T = (V, E_1)$ of $G$ such that 
the total weight of $T$, defined as $\sum_{e\in E_1} w(e)$, is minimized.
Such tree $T$ is also called a minimum spanning tree~(MST) of $G$.
MST problem has been widely used in in real-world applications.
Essentially, this is because MST is the most efficient way to connect all
vertices: one can use edge weight to model the cost of connecting
two vertices, and a MST gives a way to connect all vertices with minimized total costs.

We now design algorithms to solve the MST problem.
We will use a new algorithm-design technique: \emph{greedy}.
In general, a greedy algorithm iteratively constructs a solution,
and in each iteration, chooses the optimal solution based on the \emph{current} state.
In other words, a greedy algorithm consists of a series of \emph{local-optimal} decisions.
Whether or not a greedy algorithm results in a \emph{global} optimal solution
needs a proof.

Recall that a spanning tree of $G = (V, E)$ consits of $(|V| - 1)$ edges.
As an MST seeks a spanning tree with minimized total weights,
we are therefore motivated to pick edges with small weights when constructing
the spanning tree---this is a greedy strategy.
Recall we have two different ways to construct a spanning tree, i.e., 
either pick $(|V|-1)$ edges that are acyclic,
or pick $(|V|-1)$ edges that connects all vertices.
These two approaches, together with the greedy strategy,
%~(i.e., pick an edge with smallest weight whenever possible), 
lead to two greedy algorithms, the Kruskal's algorithm and the Prim's algorithm.

\subsection*{Kruskal's Algorithm}

Kruskal's algorithm can be summarized as: \emph{iteratively pick $(|V|-1)$ edges,
and in each iteration, pick the smallest edge that doesn't produce a cycle}.
The pseudo-code is given below, where we use $E_1$ to store
the edges picked. See an example in Figure~\ref{fig:mst1}.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {9}{Algorithm Kruskal's~(graph $G = (V, E)$)}\xxx
	\aab {sort all edges in increasing order w.r.t.\ weights;}\xxx
	\aab {init $E_1 = \emptyset$;}\xxx
	\aaB {5}{for $e\in E$ in above order}\xxx
	\aaC {3}{if~($E_1\cup\{e\}$ doesn't form a cycle)}\xxx
	\aad {$E_1 = E_1\cup\{e\}$;}\xxx
	\aad {if~($|E_1| = |V| -1$): report $E_1$ and exit;}\xxx
	\aac {end if;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

Note that above algorithm is a framework, as how to decide if $E_1\cup\{e\}$
produces cycles is not specified. Later on we will introduce a new data
structure, namely \emph{disjoint set}, to efficiently do that.
We also need to prove the correctness of the Kruskal's algorithm, i.e.,
it always finds an MST; we will do that later on.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{mst1}}
\caption{Running Kruskal's algorithm. The cycled numbers give the order edges are picked.}
\label{fig:mst1}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Prim's Algorithm}

Prim's algorithm combines the greedy strategy~(i.e., pick the smallest edge whenever possible)
and the 2nd way to construct a spanning tree~(i.e., pick $(|V|-1)$ edges that connects all vertices).
To connect all vertices, we can start from an \emph{arbitrary} vertex and iteratively
make it connected to all other vertices. As we need to use $(|V| - 1)$ edges to connect
to all other $(|V|-1)$ vertices, therefore every edge we pick needs to be connected to a
\emph{new} vertex.
Prim's algorithm can be summarized as: \emph{iteratively pick $(|V|-1)$ edges,
and in each iteration, pick the smallest edge that connects to a new vertex}.
We again use $E_1$ to store the picked edges.
We also use $S$ to store the vertices that have been connected.
The pseudo-code is given below.  See an example in Figure~\ref{fig:mst2}.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {8}{Algorithm Prim's~(graph $G = (V, E)$)}\xxx
	\aab {init $E_1 = \emptyset$;}\xxx
	\aab {init $S$ with an arbitrarily picked vertex;}\xxx
	\aaB {4}{for $k = 1 \to |V| - 1$}\xxx
	\aac {pick the smallest edge $e = (u,v)$ that connects to a new vertex~(i.e., $u\in S$ and $v\not\in S$);}\xxx
	\aac {$E_1 = E_1\cup\{e\}$;}\xxx
	\aac {$S = S\cup\{v\}$;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{mst2}}
\caption{Running Prim's algorithm with $S$ being initialized as $\{a\}$. The cycled numbers give the order edges are picked.}
\label{fig:mst2}
\end{figure}


Again the above algorithm is a framework, as how to select the
smallest edge that connects to a new vertex is not specified. 
Later on we will use \emph{priority queue} to efficiently do that.
We also need to prove the correctness of the Prim's algorithm, i.e., it can always find
an MST; we will do that later on.
