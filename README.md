## About the Notes

These are the lecture notes I (Mingfu Shao) used when teaching the undergrad-level `Data Structures and Algorithms` (CMPSC 465) at Penn State.
The purpose of writing these notes is to provide students with a one-stop, complete set of materials for them to review after class.
Students found them very helpful which motivates me to make them public for broader use.

When writing them I am trying to (a), provide both intuitive explanations and rigorous proofs; (b), give pseudo-code for all algorithms;
(c), give as many examples and figures as possible.

## License

The notes are distributed under CC-BY-NC license.

## How to Use

To compile into a pdf file, run twice of `pdflatex main.tex`.

## Feedback

I am sure there are many typos and errors and they can be greatly improved.
If you identify any errors or have comments/suggestions on how to making them better,
please post an "Issue" in this GitHub repo or let me know via email mxs2589@psu.edu. Thank you.
