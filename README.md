## About the Notes

These are the lecture notes I (Mingfu Shao) used when teaching the undergrad-course "Data Structures and Algorithms" (CMPSC 465) at Penn State.
The purpose of these notes is to provide students with a one-stop, complete set of materials to review after class.
Students found them very helpful which motivates me to make them public for broader use.

When writing them I am trying to provide (a), both intuitive explanations and rigorous proofs; (b), pseudo-code for each algorithm;
and (c), as many examples and figures as possible.

## License

## How to Use

To compile into a pdf file, run twice of `pdflatex main.tex`.
