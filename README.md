## About the Notes

These are the lecture notes I (Mingfu Shao) used when teaching the undergrad-course "Data Structures and Algorithms" (CMPSC 465) at Penn State.
The main purpose of writing these notes is to provide students with a one-stop, complete set of materials for them to review after class.
Students found them very helpful which motivated me to release them; hopefully more can find them useful.

When writing them I was trying to provide (a), both intuitive explanations and rigorous proofs, (b), pseudo-code for each algorithm,
and (c), as many examples and illustrative figures as possible.

## Compilation

To compile into a pdf file, run twice of `pdflatex main.tex`.
Pre-complied versions are available at [releases](https://github.com/Shao-Group/lecture-notes-for-algorithms/releases).

## License

The notes are distributed under CC-BY-NC license.

## Feedback

I will continue to improve them.
If you identify any typos/errors or have comments/suggestions on how to make them better,
please post an "Issue" in this GitHub repo or let me know via email mxs2589 AT psu DOT edu. Thank you.
