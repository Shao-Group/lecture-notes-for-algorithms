\section{Connectivity of Directed Graphs}

\subsection*{DFS with Timing}

%We now design another variant of DFS algorithm, which will be used to construct the linerization of DAGs, while also
%can construct meta-graphs for (general) directed graphs. This variant of DFS, called 
The DFS-with-timing is a variant of DFS that records the time of starting and finishing the explore
of each vertex. It uses the following data structures~(we assume $n = |V|$).
These data structures are global variables, so that the explore function
can get access to and edit them.

\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item variable clock servers as a timer that stores the current time;
\item binary array $visited[1..n]$, where $visited[i]$ indicates if $v[i]$ has been explored/visited, $1 \le i \le n$;
\item array $pre[1..n]$, where $pre[i]$ records the time of starting exploring $v_i$, $1 \le i \le n$;
\item array $post[1..n]$, where $post[i]$ records the time of finishing exploring $v_i$, $1 \le i \le n$;
\item array $postlist$, stores the vertices in \textcolor{black}{decreasing} order of $post[\cdot]$.
\end{enumerate}

The pseudo-code of DFS with timing is given below.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {7}{function DFS-with-timing ($G = (V, E)$)}\xxx
	\aab {$clock = 1$;}\xxx
	\aab {$postlist=\emptyset$;}\xxx

\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {10}{function explore ($G = (V, E), v_i \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {$visited[i] = 1$;}\xxx
	\aab {$pre[i] = clock$;}\xxx
	\aab {$clock = clock + 1$;}\xxx

	\aab {$clock = clock + 1$;}\xxx
	\aab {add $v_i$ to the {front} of $postlist$;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

An example of running DFS with timing is given below.
Notice that this algorithm partitions all edges into two categories:
solid edges $(u,v)$ implies that $v$ is visited for the first time~(and therefore explore $v$ will start right now, and after exploring
$v$ the program will return to explore $u$),
while dashed edges $(u,v)$ implies that at that time $v$ has been visited already~(and therefore $v$ will be skipped and the next 
out-edge of $u$ will be examined in the for-loop). 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{dfs-directed}}
\caption{Example of running DFS~(with timing) on a directed graph. 
The $[pre,post]$ interval for each vertex
is marked next to each vertex. 
\textcolor{black}{The $postlist$ for this run is $postlist = (v_4,v_7,v_1,v_3,v_6,v_2,v_5)$.}}
\label{fig:dfs-directed}
\end{figure}


In explore $v_i$, the adjacent vertices $\{v_j \mid
(v_i, v_j)\in E\}$ can be examined in any arbitrary order, i.e., all
conclusions/properties we show hold regardless the order that $\{v_j\}$ gets examined.
In practice though, we might follow a specific order;
in Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-directed}, we examine $\{v_j\}$ in increasing order of their indexes.

The above DFS-with-timing algorithm runs in $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$ time, since
each vertex and each edge will be examined a constant number of times~(once for
directed graph, twice for undirected graph).


The above DFS-with-timing algorithm gives an interval $[pre,post]$ for each vertex.
For two vertices $v_i,v_j\in V$, their corresponding intervals can either be
\emph{disjoint}, i.e., the two intervals do not overlap, or \emph{nested}, i.e.,
one interval is within the other. See Figure~\ref{fig:interval}.
But two intervals cannot be \emph{partially overlapping}. Why? This is because
the explore funtion is recursive. There are only two possiblities
that $pre[i] < pre[j]$. The first one is that explore $v_j$ is \emph{within} explore $v_i$;
in this case the recursive behaviour of explore leads to that $post[j] < post[i]$,
as explore $v_j$ must terminate first and return to explore $v_i$.
This case corresponds to that the two intervals are nested.
The second one is that explore $v_j$ starts after explore $v_i$ finishes;
this case corresponds to that the two intervals are disjoint.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{interval}}
\caption{Relations between two $[pre,post]$ intervals.}
\label{fig:interval}
\end{figure}

\begin{claim}
If the $[pre[j], post[j]]$ is nested within $[pre[i], post[i]]$, then $v_j$ is reachable from $v_i$.
\label{claim:path}
\end{claim}

\emph{Proof.} 
%Note that for the first case, if the inverval for $v_j$ is nested within the interval for $v_i$,
%then we can conclude that $v_j$ is reachable from $v_i$. Why? 
Consider when an explore will be called within another explore: 
only if there is an edge $(v_i, v_j)\in E$~(and $visited[j] = 0$), explore $v_j$ will be called within explore $v_i$.
Consequently, the time interval for $v_j$ will be within the interval for $v_i$.
Note that explore $v_j$ might call explore other vertices, such as explore $v_k$.
When this happens, the time interval for $v_k$ will be within the interval for $v_j$, and therefore within
the interval for $v_i$.  
But again this happens only if there exists edge $(v_j, v_k)$, and hence a path $v_i \to v_j \to v_k$.
This argument can be extended to longer paths, proving the conclusion above. \qed


\subsection*{Determine of Existence of Cycles}

Let's see the first application of DFS-with-timing---to decide if a given (directed) graph contains cycles or not.
We can simply modify the explore function, given below, and use the same DFS-with-timining function.
Specifically, when the algorithm examines an edge $(v_i, v_j)$:
if $v_j$ has been explored \emph{and} its post-number has not been set yet,
then the algorithm reports that $G$ contains cycle.

%%\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
%%	\aaA {8}{function DFS ($G = (V, E)$)}\xxx
%%	\aab {$clock = 1$;}\xxx
%%	\aab {$visited[i] = 0, pre[i] = -1, post[i] = -1$, for $1\le i \le |V|$;}\xxx
%%	\aaB {4}{for $i = 1 \to |V|$}\xxx
%%	\aaC {2}{if ($visited[i] = 0$)}\xxx
%%	\aad {explore ($G, v_j$);}\xxx
%%	\aac {end if;}\xxx
%%	\aab {end for;}\xxx
%%	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
%%\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {11}{function explore ($G = (V, E), v_i \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {$visited[i] = 1$;}\xxx
	\aab {$pre[i] = clock$;}\xxx
	\aab {$clock = clock + 1$;}\xxx
	\aaB {3}{for any edge $(v_i, v_j) \in E$}\xxx
	\aac {if ($visited[j] = 0$): explore ($G, v_j$);}\xxx
	\aac {\textcolor{red}{else if ($post[j] = -1$): report ``$G$ contains cycle''};}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aab {$post[i] = clock$;}\xxx
	\aab {$clock = clock + 1$;}\xxx
	\aab {add $v_i$ to the {front} of $postlist$;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


Now let's prove this algorithm is correct.
We first prove that if $G$ contains cycle then the algorithm will always report at some time.
Let $C$ be the cycle.
Let $v_j \in C$ be the first vertex that is explored in $C$.
Let $(v_i, v_j) \in E$ be an edge in $C$.
As $v_j$ can reach $v_i$~(reason: both in cycle $C$), 
within exploring $v_j$ there will be a time that $v_i$ gets explored.
In explore $v_i$, consider the time of examining edge $(v_i,v_j)$: at this time $visited[j]$ has been set as 1,
but its post-number has not been set, as now the algorithm is still within exploring $v_j$.
Therefore, the algorithm will report that $G$ contains cycle. 

We then prove that if the algorithm reports, then $G$ must contain cycles.
Consider that the algorithm is exploring $v_i$, examining edge $(v_i, v_j)$ and 
finds $visited[j] = 1$ \emph{and} $post[j] = -1$.
The fact that $post[j]$ has not been set implies that the algorithm is within exploring $v_j$.
Therefore the interval for $v_i$ must be nested within the interval for $v_j$.
Following Claim~\ref{claim:path}, we know that $v_j$ can reach $v_i$.
In addition, there exists edge $(v_i, v_j)$. Combined, $G$ contains cycle.

Note that this algorithm is essentially determining if there exists edge $(v_i, v_j) \in E$
such that the interval $[pre[i], post[i]]$ is within interval $[pre[j], post[j]]$.
(Such edges are called \emph{back edges} in textbook~[DPV], page 95.)

\subsection*{Key Property of Meta-Graph}

Before seeing more applications, we prove an important property that relates the
post values and meta-graph.

\begin{claim}
Let $C_i$ and $C_j$ be two connected components of directed graph $G = (V, E)$, i.e., $C_i$ and $C_j$ are two
vertices in its coresponding meta-graph $G_M = (V_M, E_M)$. If we have $(C_i, C_j) \in E_M$ then
we must have that $\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] > \max_{v\in C_j} post[v]$.
\end{claim}

Intuitively, following an edge in the meta-graph, the largest post value decreases.
Before seeing a formal proof, please see an example in Figure~\ref{fig:dfs}:
the largest post values for $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$, and $C_4$ are 9, 6, 10, and 14,
and you may verify that following any edge in the meta-graph, the largest post value always decreases.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering{\input{dfs}}
\caption{Example of running DFS~(with timing) on a directed graph. The $[pre,post]$ interval for each vertex
is marked next to each vertex. }
\label{fig:dfs}
\end{figure}


\emph{Proof.} Let $u^* := \arg\min_{u\in C_i\cup C_j} pre[u]$, i.e., $u^*$ is the first explored vertex in $C_i\cup C_j$.
Consider the two cases. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{meta}}
\caption{Two cases in proving above claim.}
\label{fig:meta}
\end{figure}

First, assume that $u^* \in C_i$. Then $u^*$ can reach all vertices in $C_i\cup C_j\setminus \{u^*\}$.
Hence, all vertices in $C_i\cup C_j\setminus \{u^*\}$ will be explored \emph{within} exploring $u^*$.
In other words, for any vertex $v\in C_i\cup C_j\setminus \{u^*\}$, the interval $[pre[v], post[v]]$
is a subset of $[pre[u^*], post[u^*]]$. This results in two facts:
$\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] = post[u^*]$ and $\max_{v\in C_j} post[v] < post[u^*]$.
Combined, we have that $\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] > \max_{v\in C_j} post[v]$.

Second, assume that $u^* \in C_j$. Then $u^*$ can \emph{not} reach any vertex in $C_i$; otherwise
$C_i\cup C_j$ form a single connected component, conflicting to the fact that any connected component must be maximal.
Hence, all vertices in $C_i$ will remain unexplored after exploring $u^*$.
In other words, for any vertex $v\in C_i$, the interval $[pre[v], post[v]]$
locates after~(and disjoint with) $[pre[u^*], post[u^*]]$. This gives that
$\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] > post[u^*]$. Besides, 
we also have $\max_{v\in C_j} post[v] = post[u^*]$ as all vertices in $C_j\setminus \{u^*\}$ will be examined within exploring $u^*$.
Combined, we have that $\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] > \max_{v\in C_j} post[v]$.
\qed


\subsection*{Finding a Linearization of a DAG}

The above key property holds for all directed graphs.
We now consider DAGs. Note that each connected component of a DAG $G$ contains exactly one vertex, i.e., each vertex in a DAG $G$
forms the connected component of its own. (Can you spot this using Figure~\ref{fig:meta-graph}?)
This is because, if a connected component contains at least two vertices $u$
and $v$ then $u$ can reach $v$ and $v$ can reach $u$ so a cycle must exist.
Consequently, the meta-graph $G_M$ of any DAG $G$ is also itself, i.e., $G= G_M$. % for any DAG $G$.

Now let's interpret above key conclusion in the context of DAGs.
For a DAG $G = (V, E)$, components $C_i$ and $C_j$ will degenerate into two vertices, say $v_i$ and $v_j$,
edge $(C_i, C_j)\in E_M$ becomes $(v_i, v_j)\in E$, and $\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] = post[i]$, and 
$\max_{v\in C_j} post[v] = post[j]$. We have

\begin{corollary}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a DAG. If $(v_i, v_j)\in E$, then $post[i] > post[j]$.
\end{corollary}

Now recall the definition of linearization: $X$ is a linearization if and only if
for every edge $(v_i, v_j)\in E$, $v_i$ is before $v_j$ in $X$.
Since it is guaranteed above that, 
for every edge $(v_i, v_j)\in E$, $post[i] > post[j]$,
we can immediately conclude that vertices sorted in decreasing order of post-values
is a linearization! This order is nothing else but the postlist.

\begin{corollary}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a DAG. The postlist generated in the DFS-with-timing algorithm is a linearization of $G$.
\end{corollary}



\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{dfs-dag}}
\caption{Example of running DFS~(with timing) on a DAG $G$. The $[pre,post]$ interval for each vertex
is marked next to each vertex. The $postlist$ for this run is $(v_1, v_5, v_2, v_4, v_6, v_3)$, which is a linearization of $G$.}
\label{fig:meta-graph}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Finding Connected Components of Directed Graphs}

We now design algorithms to determine the connected components of directed graphs~(i.e., the vertices of its meta-graph).
Recall that the DFS algorithm introduced in Lecture 08 can successfully determine all connected components in an undirected graph.
Does this algorithm also work for directed graph? And if not, where is the problem? 
Let's run it on an example to find a clue. See Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-meta}.
Recall that the (top-layer) of the DFS algorithm is to tranverse all vertices in some ordering,
and if the current vertex $v$ is not yet visited, we will explore $v$.
For the example in Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-meta}, we run it with the (natrual) ordering $v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_{10}$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{dfs-meta}}
\caption{Run the DFS algorithm with an natural~(arbitrary) order
and a special order~(pseudo-code given below) on above example.}
\label{fig:dfs-meta}
\end{figure}

The resulting visited array is given in the figure~(please make sure you try it yourself).
Unfortunately, it does not give all connected components. In fact, the vertices marked as ``1''s are the union of $C_3$ and $C_4$,
and the vertices marked as ``2''s are the union of $C_1$ and $C_2$.
The reason is quite clear: we start with explore $v_1$, and during it all vertices reachable from $v_1$ will be marked as ``1'' in the visited array.
It turns out that $v_1$ is in connected component $C_4$, and $C_4$ can reach $C_3$ in the meta-graph.
Therefore, all vertices in $C_4$ and $C_3$ are reachable from $v_1$; consequently, the visited array is set as ``1'' for 
vertices in $C_4$ and $C_3$ during explore $v_1$. 
Similarly, we can also see why the vertices marked as ``2''s are the union of $C_1$ and $C_2$.
After exploring $v_1$, $\{v_1,v_2,v_7\}$ are visited; the next unvisited vertex is $v_3$ according to above natural ordering,
then the algorithm will explore $v_3$.
Again, during it all (unvisited) vertices reachable from $v_3$ will be marked as ``2'' in the visited array.
It turns out that $v_3$ is in connected component $C_1$, and $C_1$ can reach $C_2$ in the meta-graph.
Therefore, all vertices in $C_1$ and $C_2$ are reachable from $v_2$;
consequently, the visited array is set as ``2'' for 
vertices in $C_1$ and $C_2$. 

How to fix this issue? The idea is to use a \emph{special ordering} of vertices, instead of an arbitrary ordering, in above DFS.
This special ordering should allow us to determine connected component one by one. Hence, the first vertex we explore in DFS,
should be one vertex in a \emph{sink} component of the meta-graph. In Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-meta}, the only sink component is $C_3$,
and since there is only one vertex in $C_3$, we should start with exploring $v_2$.
Clearly, exploring $v_7$ will exactly determine the single connected component $C_2$.
Next, after $C_3$ is determined, the next component we can determine is again a sink component after removing $C_3$ from the meta-graph.
It is $C_4$. So, the next vertex the DFS should explore must be $v_1$ or $v_7$. It does matter which one we pick; let's assume we pick $v_7$~(and it
does not matter where $v_1$ is in the special ordering as long as it is after $v_2$ and $v_7$).
Clearly, exploring $v_2$ will exactly determine the single connected component $C_4$---see the visited array.
The next component we can determine is again a sink component after removing $C_3$ and $C_4$ from the meta-graph.
It is $C_2$. So, the next vertex the DFS should explore must be in $\{v_4, v_5,v_6,v_9\}$. 
And it does matter which one we pick neither the ordering of remaining ones as long as they are behind the one we pick.
Let's say we pick $v_4$. Clearly, exploring $v_4$ will exactly determine the single connected component $C_2$.
Now the only component remaining is $C_1$ after removing $C_2$, $C_3$ and $C_4$ from the meta-graph.
So, the next vertex the DFS should explore must be in $\{v_3, v_8, v_{10}\}$. 
Let's say we pick $v_8$. Clearly, exploring $v_8$ will exactly determine the last connected component $C_1$.
In Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-meta}, we give such a special order that follows above analysis.
You should try it---run DFS following this special order correctly identifies all connected components, as shown in the Figure.

Let's summarize above observation/analysis, aiming for characterizing/constructing the special order.
First, it should be clear now that, the identified connected components,
following the special order, forms a reverse-linearization of the
meta-graph.  (Verify this with the Figure: the revealed connected components is
$(C_3, C_4, C_2, C_1)$ which is a reverse-linearization of the meta-graph.)
Second, the first appearance of a vertex in a connectec component matters, as exploring it identifies the entire connected component.
Combined, the special ordering of vertices should satisfy this condition:
\emph{the first appearance of connected components in the special ordering
should form a reverse-linearization of the meta-graph}.
Again see Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-meta}, the ordering 
$( v_{2} ,v_{7} ,v_{4} ,v_{6} ,v_{8} ,v_{1} ,v_{3} ,v_{9} ,v_{10} ,v_{5})$ satisfies above condition.
To see that, the corresponding list of connected components is 
$(C_3, C_4, C_2, C_2, C_1, C_4, C_1, C_2, C_1, C_2)$,
and hence the ordering of their first appearance is $(C_3, C_4, C_2, C_1)$ which is indeed a reviers-linearization of the meta-graph.

If the special ordering satisfies this condition, the DFS algorithm will
work---it will identify all connected components. See the pseudo-code below. 
It is the same with that for undirected graphs 
except a single line of difference~(marked blue).

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {8}{function DFS ($G = (V, E)$) \emph{it identifies connected components for directed graphs}}\xxx
	\aab {num-cc = 0;}\xxx
	\aaB {5}{for \textcolor{blue}{$v_i$ in a specific order}}\xxx
	\aaC {3}{if ($visited[i] = 0$)}\xxx
	\aad {num-cc = num-cc + 1;}\xxx
	\aad {explore ($G, v_j$);}\xxx
	\aac {end if;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {5}{function explore ($G = (V, E), v_i \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {$visited[i] = $ num-cc;}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{for any edge $(v_i, v_j) \in E$}\xxx
	\aac {if ($visited[j] = 0$): explore ($G, v_j$);}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


The remaining question is therefore how to find an ordering of vertices that satisfy above condition.
Recall the key property we proved in Lecture 10: for any two connected components $C_i$ and $C_j$, if $(C_i, C_j) \in E_M$ then
$\max_{u\in C_i} post[u] > \max_{v\in C_j} post[v]$.
%Hence, connected components sorted by the largest post-value in descending order forms a linearization of the meta-graph.
Consider the postlist, i.e., the list of vertices in descending order of post-values.
The \emph{first} appearance of (a vertex in) connected component $C_i$ in the postlist
is the vertex with \emph{largest} post-value in $C_i$, simply because postlist sorts vertices in descending order of post-values.
According to the key property, if $(C_i, C_j)\in E_M$, then the first appearance of $C_i$ is before the first appearance of $C_j$.
This implies the following fact.
\begin{claim}
Let $G$ be a directed graph. After running DFS-with-timing on $G$,
the first appearance of connected components in the resulting postlist forms a linearization of $G_M$.
\end{claim}

We are close. The desired special order requires 
``the first appearance of connected components in the special ordering form a reverse-linearization of the meta-graph'',
while the postlist yields 
``the first appearance of connected components in the postlist form a linearization of the meta-graph'',
How to close this last gap? The answer is the reverse-graph!
We can build the reverse graph $G_R$ of the given directed graph $G$,
and then run DFS-with-timing on $G_R$ to get a postlist.
This postlist will be the desired, magic special order!
See the pseudo-code below.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {4}{Algorithm to determine the \textcolor{blue}{specific order}}\xxx
	\aab {build $G_R$ of $G$;}\xxx
	\aab {run DFS with timing on $G_R$ to get $postlist_R$;}\xxx
	\aab {return $postlist_R$;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

We now show that, above $postlist_R$, i.e., the one obtained by running DFS-with-timing on $G_R$,
satisfies the condition that ``the first appearance of connected components in 
this $postlist_R$ forms a reverse-linearization of the meta-graph $G_M$''.
In fact,  since this $postlist_R$ is obtained by running DFS-with-timing on $G_R$,
applying Claim~\ref{fig:claim1},
we know that the first appearance of connected components in $postlist_R$ forms a linearization of meta-graph of $G_R$,
which is $(G_R)_M$.
According to the properties of reverse graph, we know that $(G_R)_M = (G_M)_R$.
We also know that a linearization of $(G_M)_R$ is a reverse-linearization of $G_M$.
Hence, we have that, 
the first appearance of connected components in $postlist_R$ forms a reverse-linearization $G_M$, proving
that $postlist_R$ is the desired special order.
%This $postlist$ can therefore be used by the DFS algorithm as a special order to obtain all connected components.
