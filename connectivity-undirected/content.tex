\section{Connectivity of Undirected Graphs}

A \emph{path}~(also called \emph{walk} in some literature)
in a graph $G$ is a sequence of vertices and edges,
where each edge is incident to its preceding and succeeding vertices.
%In directed graphs, two consecutive edges in a path must be in the form of $(v_a, v_b), (v_b, v_c)$,
%i.e., the head of the predecessor connects to the tail of successor. 
Note that paths may contain duplicate vertices or edges.
We say a path is \emph{simple}, if it does not contain repeated vertex.
If there exists a path from $u$ to $v$,
then we also say $u$ can reach $v$, or $v$ is reachable from $u$, or $v$ can be reached from $u$.
These definitions applies to both directed and undirected graphs.
Clearly, in undirected graphs, $u$ can reach $v$ is equivalent to that $v$ can reach $u$.
But this is not the case for directed graphs.

%Let $u,v\in V$. We say $u$ and $v$ are \emph{connected} if and only if there exists a path from $u$ to $v$
%and there exists a path from $v$ to $u$. In undirected graph, the existence of a path from $u$ to $v$ implies the
%existence of a path from $v$ to $u$. It's not necessarily the case in directed
%graphs. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:explore-directed}, there exists a path from $v_1$ to $v_5$ but there is no path
%from $v_5$ to $v_1$~(so they are not connected).
%
%Let $G = (V, E)$. Let $V_1\subset V$. We say $V_1$ is a \emph{connected component} of $G$,
%if and only if (1), for \emph{every pair of} $u,v\in V_1$, $u$ and $v$ are connected,
%and (2), $V_1$ is \emph{maximal}, i.e., there does not exists vertex $w\in V\setminus V_1$ such
%that $V_1\cup \{w\}$ satisfies condition (1).
%For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:explore-directed}, $\{v_1, v_3, v_6\}$ is a connected component;
%$\{v_2\}$ is a connected component; 
%$\{v_1, v_3\}$ is not a connected component~(as it is not maximal). 

%Below, we will design algorithms to reveal the connectivity-structures of graphs, i.e.,
%what their connected components are and how these connected components are connected.

One basic procedure in graphs is to find the set of vertices that are reachable from a given vertex.
We will use an array, called $visited$, of size $|V|$, to store the vertices that are reachable from
the given vertex $v_i$: $visited[j] = 1$ if and only if there exists a path from $v_i$ to $v_j$.
This array will be initialized as 0 for all entries.
The following recursive algorithm, named \emph{explore}, finds all vertices that are reachable from $v_i$
and stores these vertices in $visited$ array properly.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {5}{function explore ($G = (V, E), v_i \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {$visited[i] = 1$;}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{for each $v_j$ where $(v_i, v_j) \in E$}\xxx
	\aac {if ($visited[j] = 0$): explore ($G, v_j$);}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

In above algorithm, we can assume that $G$ is represented/stored with adjacency list.
In this case, the tranverse of $v_j$ can be done by simply tranversing the list associated with $v_i$
in the adjacency list. 

The time complexity of explore function is $\Theta(|E|)$, as it may traverse
all lists in the adjacency list at most once, and we have showed that 
the total size of all lists is $\Theta(|E|)$.

%\section*{DFS and Connectivity of Graphs}
%Recall that the \emph{explore} function starting from a given vertex $v$ finds all vertices in $G$ reachable from $v$.  

Below we give two examples of running $explore$~(Figure~\ref{fig:explore-undirected} and Figure~\ref{fig:explore-directed}). 
%We represent the running process
%using a \emph{search graph}: 
%we draw a new vertex $v_j$ in the search graph when we start calling $explore~(G, v_j)$; 
%we draw a \emph{tree edge}, shown with solid lines below, if we examine an edge $(v_i, v_j)$ and $visited[j] = 0$;
%we draw a \emph{back edge}, shown with dashed lines below, if we examine an edge $(v_i, v_j)$ and $visited[j] = 1$.

\end{figure}

We now define ``connected'' and ``connected component'' to formally reveal the connectivity-structure of graphs.
Let $u,v\in V$. We say $u$ and $v$ are \emph{connected} if and only if there exists a path from $u$ to $v$
\emph{and} there exists a path from $v$ to $u$. 
We note that this definition applies to both directed and undirected graph.
In undirected graph, the existence of a path from $u$ to $v$ implies the
existence of a path from $v$ to $u$. However, this is not necessarily true in directed
graphs. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:explore-directed}, there exists a path from $v_1$ to $v_5$ but there is no path
from $v_5$ to $v_1$~(so they are not connected).

Let $G = (V, E)$. Let $V_1\subset V$. We say $V_1$ is a \emph{connected component} of $G$,
if and only if (1), for \emph{every pair of} $u,v\in V_1$, $u$ and $v$ are connected,
and (2), $V_1$ is \emph{maximal}, i.e., there does not exists vertex $w\in V\setminus V_1$ such
that $V_1\cup \{w\}$ satisfies condition (1).
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:explore-directed}, $\{v_1, v_3, v_6\}$ is a connected component;
$\{v_2\}$ is a connected component; 
$\{v_1, v_3\}$ is not a connected component~(as it is not maximal, i.e., does not satisfy condition 2). 

The explore algorithm identifies all vertices reachable from a given vertex $v_i$.
Hence, in the case of undirected graphs, these vertices~(including $v_i$) are pairwise reachable, 
and these vertices are also maximal~(as otherwise the explore function will find them).
In other words, $explore(G,v_i)$ identifies the connected component of $G$ that includes $v_i$.

\begin{fact}
For undirected graphs, after $explore(G, v_i)$, the vertices that are marked by $visited$, i.e.,
$\{v_j \mid visited[j] = 1\}$ forms a connected component of $G$ that includes $v_i$.
\end{fact}

The above fact does not apply to directed graph: Figure~\ref{fig:explore-directed} gives such an example,
where $\{v_1,v_2,v_3,v_5,v_6\}$ does not form a connected component. Note: in directed graphs
$\{v_j \mid visited[j] = 1\}$ are still those vertices that are reachable from $v_i$; it's just that
they may not be a connected component of $G$.

How to identify \emph{all} connected components of an undirected graph?
We can run above explore algorithm multiple times, each of which starts from an un-explored vertex,
until all vertices are explored. To keep track of which vertices are in which connected
component, we will introduce variable \emph{num-cc} to store the index of current connected component.
We redefine the behavior of $visited$ array: $visited[j] = 0$ still represents that $v_j$ has not yet been explored;
$visited[j] = k$, $k\ge 1$, represents that $v_j$ has been explored and $v_j$ is in the $k$-th connected component.

This new algorithm that traverses all vertices and edges of a graph is named as DFS~(depth first search).
We also slightly changed the explore function, which allows to store which connected component each vertex is in.
The pseudo-codes are given below.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {9}{function DFS ($G = (V, E)$)}\xxx
	\aab {num-cc = 0;}\xxx
	\aab {$visited[i] = 0$, for all $1\le i \le |V|$;}\xxx
	\aaB {5}{for $i = 1 \to |V|$}\xxx
	\aaC {3}{if ($visited[i] = 0$)}\xxx
	\aad {num-cc = num-cc + 1;}\xxx
	\aad {explore ($G, v_i$);}\xxx
	\aac {end if;}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}


\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {5}{function explore ($G = (V, E), v_i \in V$)}\xxx
	\aab {$visited[i] = $ \textcolor{blue}{num-cc};}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{for each $v_j$ where $(v_i, v_j) \in E$}\xxx
	\aac {if ($visited[j] = 0$): explore ($G, v_j$);}\xxx
	\aab {end for;}\xxx
	\aaa {end algorithm;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

Below we gave examples of running DFS on undirected graphs and undirected graphs.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{dfs-undirected}}
\caption{Running $DFS~(G)$ on an undirected graph.}
\label{fig:dfs-undirected}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering{\input{dfs-directed}}
\caption{Running $DFS~(G)$ on a directed graph.}
\label{fig:dfs-directed}
\end{figure}

DFS runs in $\Theta(|E| + |V|)$ time. This is because, each vertex
is explored exactly once, and each edge is examined exactly once~(in the case of directed graphs)
or exactly twice~(in the case of undirected graphs).

\begin{fact}
For undirected graphs, DFS~($G$) identifies all connected components of $G$:
	$\{v_j \mid visited[j] = k \}$ constitutes the $k$-th connected component of $G$.
\end{fact}

Again, the above fact does not apply to directed graphs: $\{v_j \mid visited[j] = k\}$
are not necessarily form a connected component, although you can still run DFS on directed graphs. In
Figure~\ref{fig:dfs-directed}, $\{v_j \mid visited[j] = 1\}$ gives such an counter-example.
