\section*{Weighted Interval Scheduling Problem}

\subsection*{The Problem}

Given an array of \emph{intervals} $A[1\cdots n]$, where $A[i] = (s(i),t(i))$ is an interval represented with
\emph{start-time} $s(i)$ and \emph{finish-time} $t(i)$, and value $v(i)$ associated with $A[i]$, we seek a \emph{compatible} subset $X\subset A$
such that the total value of the intervals in $X$, i.e., $\sum_{A[i]\in X} v(i)$,
is maximized. Again, $X$ is \emph{compatible} is defined as that intervals in $X$
are disjoint~(i.e., any two intervals in $X$ don't overlap).  See an instance in Figure~\ref{fig:interval}.
Clearly, this weighted interval scheduling problem is a generalization
of the interval scheduling problem introduced in last lecture,
for which each interval is associated with unit value, i.e., $v(i) = 1, 1\le i \le n$.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{interval}}
\caption{An instance of the weighted interval scheduling problem.
The optimal solution includes 3 intervals $\{1, 2, 3\}$,
and the (optimal) total value is 18.}
\label{fig:interval}
\end{figure}

Can we also design a greedy algorithm like we did for the interval scheduling problem?
Let's try. Again the framework is to maintain a compatible subset $X$, and
in each iteration we add one more interval that is compatible with $X$.
We now explore different greedy strategies. 

\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item In each iteration, pick the interval with the earliest finish-time that is compatible with $X$---which has been proved optimal for the unit-value version.
However, this strategy isn't optimal here---Figure~\ref{fig:interval} is an counter-example, where this greedy strategy finds intervals $\{1, 2, 5, 6\}$ with a total value of 14.
\item In each iteration, pick the interval with largest value that is compatible with $X$.
This strategy isn't optimal either.
Figure~\ref{fig:interval} is again a counter-example, where this greedy strategy finds intervals $\{3, 4\}$ with a total value of 16.
\end{enumerate}

As you can see, all these greedy strategies fail. In fact, it's unlikely to design a greedy algorithm for this problem.
We therefore seek other techniques. Below we will design a dynamic programming algorithm.

\subsection*{A Dynamic Programming Algorithm}

Recall that in order to design a DP algorithm, we need to figure out its \emph{optimal substructure}.
Does this problem satisfy the optimal substructure property?
Let's check Figure~\ref{fig:interval} to try to get some clue.
In that example, the \emph{optimal solution} is a set of intervals, namely $X = \{A[1], A[2], A[3]\}$.
Naturally, the \emph{substructure} of this optimal solustion is one of its subset, say, $X' = \{A[1], A[2]\}$, by removing one element $A[3]$.
Then we ask: is $X'$ the \emph{optimal solution} of certain subproblem?
In fact, yes! If we exclude $A[3]$ and all intervals that conflict with $A[3]$ from $A$,
the remaining will be $A' = \{A[1], A[2], A[4], A[7]\}$, and $X'$ is 
the \emph{optimal solution} of $A'$. (The proof is again a replacing argument: if there exists a
better solution~(than $X'$) of $A'$, then we can combine it with $A[3]$ to get a better solution of $A$.)
So, this problem indeed satisfies an optimal substructure property, and therefore a DP algorithm can be designed.

In fact, a direct use of above optimal substructure leads to exponential number of subproblems~(as we need to
define a subproblem for \emph{every} possible subset of $A$). We need an ordering to reduce
the number of subproblems.  Again, we can sort all intervals by their finish-time~(and rename them;
now we assume that all intervals in $A$ are sorted; see Figure~\ref{fig:order}).
Now let's check the optimal substructure again with sorted intervals.
The optimal solution is $X = \{A[1], A[3], A[6]\}$.
Consider its substructure $X' = \{A[1], A[3]\}$ by removing the last one in the order, i.e., $A[6]$.
We have that $X'$ is the optimal solution of $A[1\cdots 4]$. (Again, try the replacement-argument to prove it).
And why $A[1\cdots 4]$? This is because these four intervals do not overlap with $A[6]$ but $A[5]$ does.
In other words, $A[4]$ is the \emph{rightmost interval before $A[6]$ that doesn't conflict with $A[6]$}.
In fact, if $A[4]$ don't overlap with $A[6]$, i.e, $t(4)\le s(6)$, then all intervals to the left of $A[4]$ will not overlap with $A[6]$
as $t(1) \le t(2) \le t(3) \le t(4)$. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{order}}
\caption{An instance of the weighted interval scheduling problem.

and the (optimal) total value is 18.}
\label{fig:order}
\end{figure}


Above analysis suggests we define subproblem over $A[1\cdots k]$ for every $1\le k \le n$.
Formally, we define $F(k)$ be the achievable total value over the first $k$ intervals, i.e., $A[1\cdots k]$.
We now develop a recursion. Again, we try to enumerate all possiblities of the last step.
Here, that's whether $A[k]$ is picked or not. Suppose that, the optimal solution~(of $A[1\cdots k]$)
doesn't include $A[k]$; in this case we have $F(k) = F(k-1)$.
Suppose that, the optimal solution includes $A[k]$; in this case we have $F(k) = v(k) + F(pre[k])$.
Here, we use term $pre[k]$ to represent the \emph{rightmost interval before $A[k]$ that doesn't conflict with $A[k]$}.
Formally, $pre[k] = \max\{j < k \mid t(j) \le s(k)\}$.
Combined, we have the following recursion.

\begin{displaymath}
F(k) = \max\left\{
	\begin{array}{lll}
		F(k-1) \\
		F(pre[k]) + v(k)
	\end{array}
\right.
\end{displaymath}

One question remain: how to calculate $pre[k]$? One straitforward approach is to 
compare $A[k]$ with all intervals before $A[k]$ in reverse order, i.e., $A[k-1], A[k-2], \cdots, A[1]$;
the first $A[j]$ satisfies that $t(j) \le s(k)$ will be $pre[k]$. 
This clearly takes linear time. In fact, we can use \emph{binary search} to get a $O(\log n)$-time algorithm.
This works because, all intervals in $A$ are already sorted by their finish-time.

Specifically, we define a recursive function \emph{binary-search~($A[1\cdots n]$, $k$, $a$, $b$)}
with 4 parameters: $A[1\cdots n]$ is the sorted $n$ intervals, $k$ specifies that we aim to calculate $pre[k]$,
$a$ and $b$ specifies the range of $A$ where we will search for. 
%Formally, we define this recursive function returns $\max\{a \le j \le b \mid t(j) \le s(k)\}$. 
Its pseudo-code is given below.
Clearly, this binary-search procedure runs in $O(\log n)$ time.
To find $pre[k]$, we actually call: \emph{binary-search~($A$, $k$, $1$, $k-1$)}.

\begin{minipage}{0.8\textwidth}
	\aaA {11}{function binary-search~($A[1\cdots n]$, $k$, $a$, $b$)}\xxx
	\aab {$m = (a + b) / 2$;}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{if~($t(m) \le s(k) \le t(m + 1)$)\ \ // $pre[k] = m$}\xxx
	\aac {return $m$;}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{else if~($t(m) > s(k)$)\ \ // $pre[k]$ must be in $[a\cdots m]$}\xxx
	\aac {return binary-search~($A$, $k$, $a$, $m$);}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{else if~($s(k) > t(m + 1)$) \ \ // $pre[k]$ must be in $[m + 1\cdots b]$}\xxx
	\aac {return binary-search~($A$, $k$, $m + 1$, $b$);}\xxx
	\aaB {2}{else}\xxx
	\aac {return 0;}\xxx
	\aab {end;}\xxx
	\aaa {end;}\xxx
\end{minipage}

The complete DP algorithm for solving the weighted interval scheduling problem is given below.
Its running time is $O(n\log n)$: the sorting step takes $\Theta(n\log n)$, and for each $k$,
the binary-search takes $O(\log n)$, and hence the entire for-loop takes $O(n\log n)$ as
well.
