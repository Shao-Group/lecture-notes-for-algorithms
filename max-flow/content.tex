\section{Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut}

A \emph{network}~(also called \emph{flow network}) models 
an abstracted flow~(traffic, data, etc) transmits from an origin to a destination
via a graphical structure. Formally, a (flow) network is a tuple $(G = (V, E), s, t, c(\cdot))$, where
%$G = (V, E)$ is a directed graph, $s\in V$ represents the source vertex~(i.e., the in-degree of $s$ is 0),
%$t\in V$ represents the sink vertex~(i.e., the out-degree of $t$ is 0),
%and $c(e) \ge 0$ represents the \emph{capacity} of edge $e\in E$.

\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G = (V, E)$ is a directed graph;
\item $s\in V$ is a source vertex of $G$~(i.e., the in-degree of $s$ is 0), from which the flow is generated;
\item $t\in V$ is a sink vertex of $G$~(i.e., the out-degree of $t$ is 0), at which the flow is absorbed;
\item $c: E\to \mathbb{R}^+$, in which $c(e)$ represents the \emph{capacity} of edge $e\in E$, which models the limit of the flow that edge $e$ can carry.
\end{enumerate}

An \emph{$s$-$t$ flow} of network $(G = (V, E), s, t, c(\cdot))$
describes {how} the flow is transmitted from $s$ to $t$
via the graph $G$ under the capacity constraints. Formally,
an $s$-$t$ flow $f$ is a function $f: E\to \mathbb{R}^+$
that satisfies the following two conditions:
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every $e\in E$, $0\le f(e) \le c(e)$; this is called the \emph{capacity condition};
\item For every vertex $v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$, $\sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e)$, where $I(v) := \{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in V\}$ represents
the set of in-edges of $v$, and $O(v) := \{(v,w)\in E\mid w\in V\}$ represents
the set of out-edges of $v$. This is called the \emph{conservation condition}.
\end{enumerate}

Intuitively, an $s$-$t$ flow assigns an non-negative value $f(e)$ to edge $e$, representing the
amount of flow that is carried by edge $e$; such amount must not exceed the capacity of $e$, i.e., $f(e) \le c(e)$, for every $e\in E$.
All vertices, except the source $s$ that generates the flow and the sink that absorbs the flow,
redistribute the flow~(instead of repositing any flow); therefore, for each vertex $v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$,
the total amount of flow that enters $v$ equals to the total amount of flow that leaves $v$.
See Figure~\ref{fig:flow}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{flow}}
\caption{An example of a network and an $s$-$t$ flow.

the flow values are marked as red numbers next to edges.}
\label{fig:flow}
\end{figure}

The \emph{value} of an $s$-$t$ flow $f$, denoted as $|f|$,
is defined as the total amount of flow that is generated from source vertex $s$:
$|f| := \sum_{e\in O(s)} f(e)$. Intuitively, the total amount of flow that is generated
from $s$ eventually must be fully absorbed by sink $t$, as all internal vertex~(i.e., $V\setminus\{s,t\}$)
don't keep any flow. Therefore, we must have that 
$|f| = \sum_{e\in I(t)} f(e)$.  
This property is also a direct consequence of the conservation property.
Below we formally state and prove it.

\begin{fact}
We have $\sum_{e\in O(s)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in I(t)} f(e)$. 
\end{fact}

\emph{Proof.} According to the conservation condition:
$\sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e)$, 
for every vertex $v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$. 
We sum up both sides over all $v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}$: 
we have $\sum_{v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) = \sum_{v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e)$. 

We now break down the left side 
$L := \sum_{v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) 
= \sum_{v\in V} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) -  \sum_{e\in I(s)} f(e) - \sum_{e\in I(t)} f(e)$.
Notice also that $\sum_{v\in V} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in E} f(e)$.
Since $s$ is a source vertex, we have $I(s) = \emptyset$, and therefore $\sum_{e\in I(s)} f(e)  = 0$.
Hence, $L = \sum_{e\in E} f(e) - \sum_{e\in I(t)} f(e)$.

Similarly, the right side 
$R := \sum_{v\in V\setminus\{s,t\}} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e) 
= \sum_{v\in V} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e) -  \sum_{e\in O(s)} f(e) - \sum_{e\in O(t)} f(e)$.
Again we have $\sum_{v\in V} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in E} f(e)$.
Since $t$ is a sink, we have $O(t) = \emptyset$, and therefore $\sum_{e\in O(t)} f(e)  = 0$.
Hence, $R = \sum_{e\in E} f(e) - \sum_{e\in O(s)} f(e)$.

Combining $L = R$ and noticing that $\sum_{e\in E} f(e)$ is shared, we have $\sum_{e\in O(s)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in I(t)} f(e)$, as desired.  \qed

We now define the \emph{maximum-flow problem}: given network $(G= (V, E), s, t, c(\cdot))$,
to find an $s$-$t$ flow $f$ such that $|f|$ is maximized.

See Figure~\ref{fig:maxflow} for an example. Playing with the instance you may find
a flow $f$ with $|f| = 9$, shown with red numbers in the figure.
It seems that this flow $f$ is a maximum flow.
Here is an argument that this flow $f$ is indeed a maximum flow.
Consider the \emph{cut} shown with blue curve. Notice that
$s$ and $t$ are on different sides of this cut. Therefore, all flow
from $s$ to $t$ must cross this cut. Notice also that there are three
cut-edges~(i.e., edges cross the border from $s$-side to $t$-side)
and the \emph{total capacities} of these 3 edges is $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$.
This gives an \emph{upper bound} of the maximum flow, which is 9.
And, we have found a flow $f$ with $|f| = 9$. Therefore, $f$
is a maximum flow.

the $s$-$t$ flow given in the left panel is a maximum flow.}

\subsection*{Minimum-Cut}

Recall that a \emph{cut} of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is defined
as a \emph{partition} of the vertices, formally written as $(S, V\setminus S)$ where $S \subset V$.
Given an network $G=(V, E)$ with source $s\in V$ and sink $t\in V$, 
an \emph{$s$-$t$ cut} of the network is defined as a cut $(S, T)$, where $S\subset V$ and $T = V\setminus S$,
satisfying that $s\in S$ and $t\in T$. In short, an $s$-$t$ cut of a network is a partition
of the vertices that separates the source and the sink.

An $s$-$t$ cut $(S, T)$ of a network $G = (V, E)$ with source $s$ and sink $t$ also partitions all
edges $E$ into four disjoint subsets, described below. 
We define the first category, i.e., $E(S, T) := \{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in S, v\in T\}$,
as the \emph{cut-edges} w.r.t.\ the $s$-$t$ cut $(S, T)$.
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Edges that span the cut and point from $s$-side to $t$-side, formally $E(S, T) := \{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in S, v\in T\}$;
\item Edges that span the cut and point from $t$-side to $s$-side, formally $E(T, S) := \{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in T, v\in S\}$;
\item Edges with both end-vertices in $s$-side, formally $E(S, S) := \{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in S, v\in S\}$;
\item Edges with both end-vertices in $t$-side, formally $E(T, T) := \{(u,v)\in E\mid u\in T, v\in T\}$.
\end{enumerate}

Let $(S, T)$ be an $s$-$t$ cut of a network $G = (V, E)$ with source $s$, sink $t$, and capacity $c(e)$ for any $e\in E$.
We define the \emph{capacity} of $(S, T)$, denoted as $c(S, T)$, as the sum of the capacities of its cut-edges. Formally
as $c(S, T) := \sum_{e\in E(S, T)} c(e)$. See Figure~\ref{fig:cut}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{cut}}
\caption{Three different $s$-$t$ cuts and their capacities of the same network.}
\label{fig:cut}
\end{figure}

We now introduce the so-called \emph{minimum-cut problem}: given network $G = (V, E)$ with source $s$, sink $t$ and capacity $c(e)$ for any $e\in E$,
   we seek an $s$-$t$ cut $(S, T)$ such that its capacity $c(S, T)$ is minimized.

Note that, the definition of $s$-$t$ cut, capacity of an $s$-$t$ cut, and above minimum-cut problem,
are completely independent of flow. Note too that, the input of the maximum-flow problem and the minimum-cut
problem is the same: a network~(consisting of a directed graph, source and sink, and edge capacities).

Although the maximum-flow problem and the minimum-cut problem are defined independently, they
can be solved by the same algorithm~(for example, the Ford-Fulkson algorithm)
and are connected by an elegant theorem~(i.e., the max-flow min-cut theorem).
Below, we first show half of this theorem.
Leter on we will introduce the Ford-Fulkson algorithm
and use it to prove the other other half of the theorem.

\subsection*{Maximum-Flow v.s.\ Minimum-Cut, One-Side Connection}

We now show that, the capacity of \emph{any} $s$-$t$ cut of a network
gives an \emph{upper bound} of the value of \emph{any} $s$-$t$ flow of the same network, 
formally stated below.
\begin{claim} \label{claim1}
Let $(G=(V, E), s, t, c(\cdot))$ be a network.
Let $f$ be an arbitrary $s$-$t$ flow and let $(S, T)$ be an arbitrary $s$-$t$ cut, of this network.
We have $|f| \le c(S, T)$.
\end{claim}

Above claim is intuitive to understand: an $s$-$t$ flow $f$ transfer $|f|$ units of flow from source $s$ to sink $t$;
since an $s$-$t$ cut $(S, T)$ separates $s$ and $t$, so the flow, all generated from $s$, must cross the cut in order to reach $t$,
and such ``crossing'' must use the cut-edges.
Hence, the total amount of the flow that can be transferred, i.e., the value of $f$, is limitted by
the total capacities of the cut-edges, i.e., the capacity of the $s$-$t$ cut.
See Figure~\ref{fig:claim}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{claim}}
\caption{An example showing Claim~\ref{claim1} and Fact~\ref{fact1}.}
\label{fig:claim}
\end{figure}


In order to formally prove above claim, we first show that, the value of an $s$-$t$ flow $f$
can also be calculated by examining the flow carried by the ``spanning edges'' of any $s$-$t$ cut.
Formally,
\begin{fact} \label{fact1}
Let $f$ be an arbitrary $s$-$t$ flow and let $(S, T)$ be an arbitrary $s$-$t$ cut, of network $(G=(V, E), s, t, c(\cdot))$.
We have $|f| = \sum_{e\in E(S, T)} f(e) - \sum_{e\in E(T, S)} f(e)$.
\end{fact}

Above fact is also intuitive to understand: $S$ is a subset that includes $s$ but excludes $t$.
See Figure~\ref{fig:claim}.
When thinking $S$ as a whole, 
the total amount of flow generated by $S$ is equal to $|f|$, as only $s$ generates flow.
On the other hand, this amount of flow emitted from $S$ 
can also be calcuated by summing up the flow leaves $S$, i.e., $\sum_{e\in E(S, T)} f(e)$,
and subtracting the amount of the flow that enters back to $S$, i.e., $\sum_{e\in E(T, S)} f(e)$.

We now formally prove Fact~\ref{fact1}. 
Similar to the proof of Fact~1 of Lecture~36, this proof also simply applies the conservation property.

\emph{Proof of Fact~\ref{fact1}.} According to conservation property, for any $v\in S\setminus \{s\}$,
we have $\sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) = \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e)$. 
We sum up both sides over all $v\in S\setminus\{s\}$: 
we have $\sum_{v\in S\setminus\{s\}} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e) = \sum_{v\in S\setminus\{s\}} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e)$. 
Note that $I(s) = \emptyset$ as $s$ is a source, so the left side of above equation can be rewritten as $\sum_{v\in S} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e)$.
Note that $|f| = \sum_{e\in O(s)} f(e)$ by definition, so the right side can be rewritten as $\sum_{v\in S} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e) - |f|$.
Combined, we have $|f| = \sum_{v\in S} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e) - \sum_{v\in S} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e)$. 
Now consider the 4 types of edges partitioned by $(S, T)$ and consider if they are taken into account by the two items
i.e., $\sum_{v\in S} \sum_{e\in O(v)} f(e)$ and $\sum_{v\in S} \sum_{e\in I(v)} f(e)$. 
\vspace*{-\topsep}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All edges in $E(S, T)$ appear in the first item, but not the second one.
\item All edges in $E(T, S)$ appear in the second item, but not the first one.
\item All edges in $E(S, S)$ appear in both items~(so they cancel out).
\item None of the edges in $E(T, T)$ appear in either item.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, we have $|f| = \sum_{e\in E(S, T)} f(e) - \sum_{e\in E(T, S)} f(e)$. \qed

We now formally prove Claim~\ref{fact1}. The proof simply combiines the capacity condition (and the non-negative property) of an $s$-$t$ flow,
Fact~\ref{fact1}, and the definition of the capacity of an $s$-$t$ cut.

\emph{Proof of Claim~\ref{claim1}.} Since $0\le f(e) \le c(e)$ for any $e\in E$,
based on Fact~\ref{fact1}, we can write
$|f| = \sum_{e\in E(S, T)} f(e) - \sum_{e\in E(T, S)} f(e)
\le \sum_{e\in E(S, T)} c(e) - 0 = c(S, T)$. \qed

Claim~\ref{claim1} states that capacity of \emph{any} $s$-$t$ cut
is larger or equal to the value of \emph{any} $s$-$t$ flow.
Consequently, if there exists an $s$-$t$ flow $f$ and an $s$-$t$ cut $(S,T)$
satisfies that $|f| = c(S, T)$, then this $f$ must be a maximum-flow,
and this $(S, T)$ must be a minimum-cut.
An illustration of this property is given in Figure~\ref{fig:meet},
where each red point represents the value of an $s$-$t$ flow
while each blue point represents the capacity of an $s$-$t$ cut.
So all red points lie to the left side of all blue points,
and if a red point and a blue point meet, they are maximum-flow and minimum-cut.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{\input{meet}}
\caption{Illustration of the relationship between capacity of any $s$-$t$ cut
and value of \emph{any} $s$-$t$ flow.  Do they always meet in the middle?}
\label{fig:meet}
\end{figure}

Does there \emph{always} exist $f$ and $(S,T)$ such that $|f| = c(S,T)$?
In Figure~2 of Lecture~36 we saw an example where such flow and cut exist.
But is this the case for \emph{every} instance?
Actually, the answer is yes! (And this suprising result is referred to the max-flow min-cut theorem.)
The proof is constructive: we will design an algorithm~(i.e., the Ford-Fulkson algorithm)
that actually always finds an $s$-$t$ flow $f$ and an $s$-$t$ cut $(S, T)$
that satisfies $|f| = c(S, T)$.
